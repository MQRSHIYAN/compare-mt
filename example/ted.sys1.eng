By the end of this year will be on this planet about billion people to use active aspects of social networks .
The only thing that they have in common is that all die .
Even when it can be a bit of a morbidn thought , I think that there &apos;s seriously impacts that it &apos;s explore .
And this idea of me by the first time this year blog from Derek K. Miller , scientific and technological journalist , who died at cancer .
And Miller to give his family and known to wrote a contribution , who was published soon after he died .
This wrote intro .
&quot; He said , &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s here . I &apos;m dead , and this is my last a blog posts . &quot;
&quot;head I asked to when my body finally get rid of weeks way cancer , to my family and friends published this setoven message — as the first part process for creating that active page on archive . &quot; &quot; As a journalist , I loveler archive was probably thewritten better and doed attention than others , but the point is that we &apos;re all today we &apos;re creating archives , who &apos;s something completely else than whatever was created itktor of the previous generation . &quot;
Think about a few statistics .
Right now , every single one minute , it &apos;s 48 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube .
Every day you send 200 million tweets .
And the average user Facebook create 90 pieces content every month .
When you think of their parents and old parents , at its best , could create a few photos or home video or a journal , who &apos;s surviving somewhere in a box .
But today , we &apos;re creating all this incredibly rich digital archive that survives in cloud permissionless , years after , as we &apos;re gone .
And I think this create some very novel possibilities for technologists .
For clar , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a journalist , I , not technology , so I from just run together wanted to lay down as will be present and future look like .
I see some services that allow us to make things decided , what happens with our online profiles and the contas social media after our death .
One of them , pretty  bottom , she found me , when I was a school in la-s in a restaurant in New York at The Foursquare .
( Anast ) Adam Ostro : &quot; &quot; hello .
Death : Adam ?
Adam Ostrow : Yeah .
Death : Death you can described anywhere , any time , even the organic food .
Adam Ostro : &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s that ?
Death , &quot; &quot; Just in the fidie — (aks die .net ) than it &apos;s too late . (Ko with recordings . )
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a bit frightening , right ?
This a service you fairly simply enable us to create a message or video that can send on Facebook , when you die .
Another current a service called 1,000 Memors (spo of ) .
It enables you to create online memory of for your loved ones , completely with the images , video and stories that can publishing to when you die .
But I think that it &apos;s what comes next , that &apos;s much more interesting .
It &apos;s probably know over Deb Ros that in March this year showed , as was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours home video .
I think that , as the ability to understand the human machine language and process large volumes data continue improving , is going to be possible to analyze the content of all life — tweets , photos , and videos , blogs — which produces in so massive volumes .
And I think , when it happens , it &apos;s possible for our digital &quot; &quot; greats &quot; &quot; continues in interactions with real world long after , as we walk out , and that &apos;s thanks to massive lot of content who we &apos;re creating and ability of technology &apos;s all understand .
Now today , we &apos;re beginning to see some of the experiments .
The service We Next , a Tweet ( &apos;s my next tweet ) and analyze it your Twitter roofam — everything you sent on Twitter , to predict what you could say on .
Well , now as you can see , they &apos;re results a little bitsic .
You can but imagine something like this about five , 10 or 20 years , with of improving our technical ability .
And it &apos;s move even further , media lab MIT working on robots that can interact more human .
But what if these robots knew interact based on unique traits a specific person based on hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that that person produced my life ?
Finally , remember the Go famous scene election night 2008 in the United States , where CNNslo living a hologram hip hop- artist will . .am of their study for interviews with Anderson Cooper .
What if we were able to use that sort of technology tos our missed into our habits and interact in very vivid form based on everything content who we &apos;ve created in life ?
I think that &apos;s going to happen really possible because volume data that we &apos;re using and technological options for their understanding is growing exponentially .
Finally , I think that we need to think about whether we want this was our reality — , and if it does , what does this mean for definition of life and everything what comes next .
Thank you very much !

Today , I &apos;m going to talk to you about of an unexpected discovers .
I &apos;m working in solar-e industry .
My little newza business is us trying to bring the care about the environment , and it &apos;s so ...
... and it &apos;s so that we &apos;re using options crowd-sourcing .
It &apos;s just so short video of what we &apos;re doing .
Heh . Hang a sec .
It can take time , until it triggers .
( Laughter ) We can — we can kind of leapfrog — Well &apos;s a video just for arresteds — ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) This is not a — ( Laughter )
It &apos;s okay . ( Laughter )
Theolry technology &apos;s ...
So my time &apos;s up ?
Okay , well . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The second is from head
And the answer is sadly yes .
Then you can do predictions and testing them .
What about complex systems we know ?
So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
Where are economic networks ?
We we focus on networks property .
Companies we grade
How are they arrangement ? They &apos;re isolated ?
They &apos;re society acting in multiple countries and we found them 43,000 .
I &apos;ll explain it in this example .
Hi . Today together on around us into my about eight projects that I made in conjunction with the Danish artist Soren of Pors .
We &apos;re talking &apos; Pors &amp; Rao and we live and work in India .
&quot; That sounds my first subject that I call &quot; &quot; My uncle-telephone . &quot; &quot; It was inspired by strange habit of my strings kept asking me to him something did , almost as if I was an extension of his body — so I turned out the lights , brought in a glass of water or crab cigarettes . &quot;
And as I &apos;ve been growing , it &apos;s still worse and worse , and I started to perceive it as a form of control .
But of course , I &apos;ve never couldn &apos;t say nothing , because uncle is respected person in India family .
And what I most annoying and what &apos;s , I don &apos;t understand was the way using phone .
He kept head from me and expected , &quot; I &apos;m going to videos number .
&quot; So response to it and as a gift for mybin &quot; &quot; I told him , made a &quot; &quot; My uncle-telephone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it &apos;s needed to operatored two people . &quot;
It &apos;s aptly right on how my uncle us phone designed for one person .
But the problem is that when she left out of home , and I went to college , started me uncleve theanding miss .
And so I made a unique writinging machine , which could commands making their sonscom , and it &apos;s around the world in the form of email .
So had to take paper to develop a it on the cylinder , writes email or command and pull paper out .
This device automatically sent letter demanded person like email .
So here you can see that we &apos;ve spent a lot of electronics that understanding all of the mechanicalon , and doing them in digital .
So my uncle works only with mechanical interface designed .
And of course , this object needs to be big and have in yourself a modicum of ofism , like my uncle has like .
&quot; The next piece is an installation sensitive to the sound that &apos;s kindly we call &quot; &quot; &quot; Pygmies . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with idea that we &apos;re surrounded by tribes very shy , sensitive and cutss . &quot;
And it &apos;s so that we have a wall these panels and to them , are this creatures .
As long as it &apos;s silence , so like this , they climb up onto .
If there &apos;s still quieter , so they are corks .
And the slightest sound youed again the hidden .
These panels we had on three walls room .
We hide themed more than 500 of these small pygms .
It &apos;s like this .
This is video prototype .
When it &apos;s silence , so slowly coming out from behind panels .
And they &apos;re hearing as people or as animals creatures .
So after a while they becomesnnys on the sounds that their desia .
And we don &apos;t sensitive to the sounds in the background .
You &apos;re going to hear the train that they don &apos;t respond .
(H noise ) But respond to the sounds in the foreground . &quot; &quot; moment that you hear .
( Whistling ) So we worked hard to created them what the most natural .
Every pygm has own behavior , psychology , which mood swings , personality and so forth .
This is a very wounded prototype .
Of course , it &apos;s then much improved .
And we made them to respond at people , but we found that people with them like to play .
&quot; This is a video an installation called &quot; &quot; called person . &quot; &quot; Dness interested playing the idea of unseenity . &quot;
What would it be like to be experience unseenity ?
So , we worked with society that specializes in cameras secure and asked them to develop software with us , using cameras that would looked at people in the room , one person and watched them replaced the background , what would cause her unseenity .
I &apos;ll show you very with a prototype .
You can see , on the right my colleague Sorena that is really in space .
And on the left you see processed video , where it camera of invisibl .
Weren &apos;s in the room . Hop ! &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s invisible .
So you can see that it &apos;s watching and me cameras .
It &apos;s very early video , so we haven &apos;t solveding and everything about it , but that &apos;s then improveed quite quickly .
We used it in a room where the camera looked into space and on each wall we had one screen .
And when people walked into a room , you see on the screen , with one difference : one person was still invisible , let &apos;s anywhere moving the room .
&quot; This is a work called &quot; &quot; song , the Sun . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s almost like a sheet of paper , the papercut as a pediatric drawings of oil &apos;s spots or sun . &quot;
Thehead this object of seem very powerful and bu real and from the side from seem very weak .
So people walked into a room and almost it ignored , thinking , that it &apos;s some garbage , what &apos;s to be off .
But once they &apos;ve gone around , began &apos;s marketing with climb to the wall .
And it &apos;s they weren &apos;t and they back down .
( Laughter ) So this work is cartoon of flipped a man .
Its head is so hard , full of tough ideas that kind of fell down into his hat and his body of him grow up almost like a plant .
And it does that that moves around very monkey these actinging way to my head , very unprecedented and extremely slow motion .
And it &apos;s as if it &apos;s restricted this circles .
Because if there wasn &apos;t this circle , and underedha would be very equals , theulate around the space .
There &apos;s no wires .
Let me show you an example of — so when people enter into room , activate this object .
And a few minutes , very slowly , it &apos;s so with the effort of person climbs up , and then it starts going on , and it looks like it &apos;s every moment had to fall .
This is a very important moment , because we wanted to viewer impact instinct almost to go and help or save this object .
But it actually doesn &apos;t need because he again can somehow pull up .
So this work was for us a real the next challenge , and worked very hard on it as the most our work for years to the mechanics , the balance and dynamics work right .
It was very important for us to make that moment , when it &apos;s nearly parachute , because if we do so that would for what was designedibility , could do it , and if it didn &apos;t , we don &apos;t enough , it would it the falism or that feeling of want to go and helping that .
I &apos;ll show you very short video , where we &apos;re doing trial — it &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my colleague . P did it .
Now it be nervous , so it &apos;s going to catch .
But you have to , because it wasn &apos;t be able to pick up .
This is the work of where we &apos;ve been very interested by working with aesthetics skin , which you put thousands of tiny fiber optic strands different sizes that glow like for the night sky .
And it &apos;s so dimensions that it looked like for the night sky .
They &apos;s about as we dropsed forms , that &apos;s in the form of teddy bear that there was from the ceiling .
And the idea was sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract , as the universe is to something that &apos;s very well known , like the honey says , which is very , very comforting and close .
And it &apos;s us about that at some point , you stop look to the shape of the teddy bear , and you start to perceive it as a hole in space and like you &apos;re looking at the glowing night sky .
&quot; This is the last job , which still does , and this is called &quot; &quot; space has a block . &quot; &quot; Imagine a little cube that &apos;s about this big , standing in front of you in the middle of the room and when to it closer , you &apos;re trying to scaring by grow on the cubes , that &apos;s twice as high and has four times so volume . &quot;
This object is constantly expand in its to created the dynamics with people around ; it around — almost like in yourself was trying to hide secret or something like that .
So we &apos;re working with a lot of technology , even though we don &apos;t like technology very we don &apos;t have , because with it in our works years we care about .
But we use it because we are interested in the way that we can help us express emotions and behavior in these creatures that we &apos;re creating .
And as soon as us some creation mind , it &apos;s almost as if process creature , to find the way that wants this creature be and form that want to have and the way they want to move around .
Thank you !

I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
Think about everything bring us .
Think of all the services that we use all the connection , all here fun , all business , all sale .
And that &apos;s happening in our lives .
I &apos;m sure that one day , we &apos;re going to writeys , hundreds of years from now . &quot; &quot; And then our generation will be generation that became online , generation that built something really and truly global .
But yeah , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with problems with security and privacy .
I &apos;ve spent my career as struggle with these issues .
Let me show you something here .
This is a Brain .
This is a disketa — five and neighborhood-ins disketa infected by a viruses Brain And .
It &apos;s the first virus that we found for personal computers .
And we know where Brain came .
We know that , because it &apos;s written in the code .
Let &apos;s look .
It &apos;s okay .
&quot; This is Godot sector infected disks . And if you look closer , we see right here says that &quot; &quot; Welcome to cave . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s go sayc 1986 , Bast and Amyad . &quot;
Bast and Amyad are names , names of Pakistan .
In fact , there &apos;s phone number and address in Pakistan .
( Laughter ) Well , a year 1986 .
Now is the world in 2011 .
That &apos;s 25 years .
The problem computer viruses has 25 years .
A a half years ago , I decided to go to Pakistan .
Let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a few photos from my stay in Pakistan .
This is a town Lahore that &apos;s about 300 miles south of Abbotttdbu , where we grab Bin Laden .
This is a typical street .
And here &apos;s a street if the leader of the journey to this building , what &apos;s 730 Nizam block in Aldma Iqbal .
I was Zaked on the door .
( Laughter ) Want to guess who open doors ?
Bast and Amyad ; they &apos;re still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That what cost is Bast .
The sitting is his brother Amyad .
These are the guys who they wrote the first computer virus .
We &apos;re , of course , a very interesting debate .
We asked why .
We asked feeling of what to start .
And so I &apos;m a little , when I found out that even Bast and Adm had infected their computers numerous times completely unknowns other viruses during those years .
So it &apos;s yet same justice in the world .
The viruss that we &apos;dy invited in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s — are not the problem .
So let me show you a few examples like used to look like .
That &apos;s what &apos;s the desertam &apos;s the system that makes me launching ancient y programs to modern computer .
You add some discs . Sem .
Here we have a list of old viruses .
So I run a few viruses on my computer .
For example , let &apos;s first at Thetipeade ( Snores ) .
And you can see on the top of the screen , a hundredd running through your computer when infects this .
You know that you were infected , because it &apos;s show .
Here &apos;s another one . This is a virus Cash (Pd ) from Russia , 1992 .
Let me show you one that makes a sound .
&quot; (H noises ) And the last example , guess what makes virus Walker (C agreementing ) .
Yes , there &apos;s pan kid walking on through screen when you infects .
So it &apos;s formerly easy to know that you &apos;re infecting inirus , when he was writing viruses hobby and back and teenagers .
Today they &apos;re not written andmatters and teenagers .
Today , they are viruses a global problem .
That &apos;s what we have in the background is an example of our system , which runs in our labs where we watch virusk infections in the world .
We can see the real time that we &apos;re turning viruses from Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and otherelig .
In fact , when I put back into our system over the Web we can see in real time demonstration of how much viruses , how many new examples harmful programs we &apos;re finding every day .
Here &apos;s newest virus that we found in the collection of Server . Sex .
We found it , right here three seconds — the previous , six seconds .
And when it &apos;s walking , it &apos;s just massive .
We &apos;re even tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands of .
And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes harmful programs (alwaru ) , every single day .
So where all come ?
Well , today it &apos;s organized criminal group (gangs ) who are writing these viruses , because they got paid .
It &apos;s groups like — let &apos;s go to the GangtBucks.com.
It &apos;s web at work in Moscow , where these people they infected computers .
So when you virus authors and you &apos;re able to infecting computers with Windows , but you don &apos;t then what with them , you can &apos;t sell — someone else &apos;s computers — these people .
And they you really will pay money for the computers .
And as they then & these infected computers ?
Well , it &apos;s more ways of like banking the soyish a horse that steal money from your online bank accounts , when you &apos;re using online graing , or theylogagery .
Keylogger quiet sitting in your computer , and tracked everything you .
You sit for your computer , and you &apos;re looking for Google .
Each one finding that you write a is recorded and send bited criminals .
Each one email that you write a is enrolled and sent criminals .
The same is true for every battle cry , and so on .
But that &apos;s what it &apos;s the most to them , they &apos;re for s sitting — withesisions ) when you &apos;re online and online you &apos;re shopping in some online store .
So6 when you &apos;re shopping online , you &apos;re writing your name , address delivering , number in your paytime cards and safety code paytime cards .
And here &apos;s an example of file that we find here on the server a couple of weeks ago .
This is a number platetime cards , the date expration , a security code , and this is the name owns of cards .
And once you &apos;ll get access to information about other people &apos;s card , you can online to buy whatever you want with these data .
And obviously , it &apos;s the problem .
They &apos;re here for black markets in underworld , a business-1 ecosystem around online crime .
One example than are these people able toize their operation . Let &apos;s go and look at page INTERPOL and let us look looked person .
We &apos;ll find people if Bjorn Sunsin , origins from Sweden , and his partner in crime , also list looked INTERPOL , Mr. Shaileshcumar Jin , sometimes the United States .
These two controlled the operation called I.M.U . , of cybercedined surgery , which to earned millions .
Both of them are in to escape .
No one know where they are .
Americanpany , just a couple of weeks ago frozen Swiss bank account belongs to Mr. Jin and the account featured 14.9 million dollars .
So volume money that generates online crime is great .
And what that means is that online criminaly can afford to invest in their attacks .
We know that online criminaly hire programmers , the hire tests , testing their code , have their systems with SQL databases .
&quot; And they can afford to watch as we &apos;re working — we humans from security — and trying to find a way of security around every steps that we come up with .
They use also global nature of the Internet to his advantage .
Because the Internet is an international .
That &apos;s why is called the Internet .
And when you look at what is happening in online world , here &apos;s the video from Clarified Networks that illustrates how one group working in the pestm software could move around the world .
This operation , the assumption origins has in Estonia , is moving from one country to the other right attempting to turning their pages .
These people just doesn &apos;t be to turn out .
We leap from one country to the other , from one jurisduction into another — carrying the world , using fact , we don &apos;t have the opportunity to global with the operations like this .
The Internet is like if someone put loose tickets all online criminals of the world .
Thes who didn &apos;t know before to us , by the time they get to us .
So actually how can we look for online criminals ?
How can you actually can .
Let me give you an example .
Here we have one file on the use of security hole — exploit .
I look at the hexyps image of file , which contains exploit .
That actually means that when you look at this image on your computer with Windows , for take &apos;s your computer and ignites code .
When you look at this images file — that &apos;s a screens the and here begins own code attack .
And that code was encrypted you cut , so wept .
He used to ad function XOR 97 .
You have to trust me , that &apos;s just , it &apos;s so .
We can go back and start to decipher .
The yellow parts code are now decrypted .
And I know that &apos;s doesn &apos;t look very different from the original .
But just look at this watch .
Here you &apos;ll see down web address theonsec.com / d / yo . &quot; &quot; And when , open up this picture on your computer he actually download and ignites the program .
&quot; It &apos;s &quot; &quot; back in &quot; &quot; — security tissues flaw , which makes forr &apos;s your computer . &quot;
But what &apos;s more interesting is when we &apos;re continuing in the decoding , find this mysterious chain , O600KO78RUS .
The code is under encrypt as some signature .
It didn &apos;t use it for anything .
As I was looking at it , I &apos;ve tried to figure out what that means .
I googed to it .
zero results ; it wasn &apos;t there .
So I &apos;ve talked about with people with the lab .
We have to us a few Russ and one of them say , well , ends at &quot; &quot;rus &quot; &quot; like Russia .
And 78 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is code city , city S . Petohra .
You can find , for example , in and phone numbers , brands cars and so forth .
So I was out looking for contacts in S . St. Peters . And after long journey we finally got to this one website .
It &apos;s this Russ , who &apos;s the online for a few years , it &apos;s own website , and from the popular blogging Live Journal .
And on this blog blogging about my life , about my life in with . &quot; &quot;Pet-grade — has something through 20 — about his cat , about his friend .
And it has a very nice car .
This youngster rides his Merceades-Benz S600 In12 with six-liters the engine and more than 400 horses .
That &apos;s really nice car to 20-some-year-old from S . Petoh .
How do I know about that car ?
Because of his blogging .
He was actually even accident .
In the center . Peter Sohra , on with their car to another car .
And he gave on a blog images this accidents — that &apos;s his Merceades — that &apos;s a Lad Samr theya .
And you can see that the brand the Samars ends at 78RUS .
And when we look at an image of all scenes , you can see that the brand Merceades is O600KO78RUS .
&quot; I &apos;m a lawyer , but if I was him was , here I said , &quot; &quot; the idea is clear . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) What actually happens when the online criminal sed ? &quot;
Well , that &apos;s most cases as far it gets .
So , most of the time online crime we don &apos;t know , it &apos;s not a continent , from which those attacks are coming .
And even when we find criminals , quite often of that eventually nothing isn &apos;t .
And the police department of uncon , or , if you do , it &apos;s not enough evidence , or from some reasons we can &apos;t to them off .
I wish that was easier ; unfortunately it &apos;s not .
But things are changing in very high rate .
You &apos;ve heard things like Studxnet .
If you look at what did Studxnet , infected this .
That &apos;s Semens S7-400 PLC , programmable a logical control units .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s moving our infrastructure .
That &apos;s moving all around us .
PLC , these little flew plagues that don &apos;t have display , or the keyboard , are programmed , stored on place and there they do their job .
For example , elevators in this building are probably controlled something like that .
And when Studxnet compromised some of them , it &apos;s massiven revolution in kind ofs the risk of that we need to care .
Because all around us is them controlled .
I think on critical infrastructure .
You go to factories , power plant , chemical plant , processing plant food , look — everything starts to be controlled computers .
All the computers .
It relies on that the computers work .
This , we are very hookeds on the Internet , on the basic things like aelecina , obviously , as the work of computers .
And it &apos;s something that for us creates completely new problems .
We &apos;ve got to have some way continuing at work even when computers fail .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Prepaveness means that we can do things even when things that we take it for granted there won &apos;t .
It &apos;s actually very about the basis — to think about continuite , about-hing , about the things that really matter .
I &apos;ll tell you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I really .
Think of all the services that they &apos;re available online .
Think about it , if you wereing , if you &apos;re their one day just didn &apos;t have , for some reason .
I see beauty in the the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s don &apos;t see .
So I &apos;m afraid that we &apos;re having problems with online crime .
Online crime &apos;s one thing that &apos;s us these things can take .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life to defending the Internet . &quot; &quot; And really I feel that , if we don &apos;t fight with online crime , we run the risk of everything that &apos;s lost .
We have to do global , and we need to do right now .
What we need is more global , international toriminalist work looking for gangs online crime — these organized gangs making on their attacks millions .
That &apos;s much more important than use anti-retrovirals and frewall .
And what really matter , is to find people behind these attacks . And more importantly , we have to find people who are becoming part of this the world online crime , but even him are not .
We have to find the people with the skills , but without opportunities and give them those opportunities , to use their abilitys act good .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I want to start by telling you , I &apos;ll offer , and in fact , what you have to do is , we at two minutes change your attitude .
But before it &apos;s you that I &apos;m going to ask you to checked their body , and it &apos;s what you do with it .
How many of you are kind of them ?
Sometimes that &apos;s how we &apos;re holding hands .
Sometimes we &apos;re expanding this . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I see you . ( Laughter )
So I want you to now attention to what you &apos;re doing .
We &apos;re fascinated language body and particularly interest
You know , we &apos;re interested in us , so , you know — ( Laughter ) — within &apos;s an interaction , or smile , flocking sight , or maybe very weird to stiring condition , or even something like undering hands .
The commentator : That &apos;s is approaching to Dom number 10 and look ,
Even for BBC and The New York Times .
So of course , when we think about the non-verbal behavior , or body language — but as sociologists we &apos;re talking nonverbal — it &apos;s speech , so we &apos;ll have in mind communication .
If we have a mind communication , we think of interactions .
It &apos;s a lot of reasons why to believe that this is the correct
And based on body language you have a lot of opinions and the conclusions .
These judgments can predict really meaningful the results , as who to or position we , who we &apos;ll phone on a date .
For example , Andni Andmbady , researchs at the University of Herephts illuminate that when people watching without sound 30-second clips a clips real interactions between physician and patients their opinions to likness doctor predicting weight , or the doctor &apos;s going to be or not be sued .
If you use them wrong , it &apos;s worse .
We &apos;re our non-verbalm speech , also influenced by our thoughts , feelings , even our physiology .
And you don &apos;tverbal gesture , I &apos;m saying ?
I &apos;m sociologist . I study biases and teaching on a business school with competition of atmosphere , so you don &apos;t avoided to started interested in the dynamics of power .
And I was interested in a particularly about nonverbal manifestations of power and dominance .
What are the non-verbal manifestations of power and dominance ?
In realms animals it &apos;s expanding .
Any time you &apos;re big , pulling in , you &apos;re in space , essentially open .
It &apos;s about taking . &quot; &quot; And this is true in all of
This speech , which became known as the pride , studied Jessica Tracy It shows that .
The our . We don &apos;t want to hit the person next to us .
And this is what happens when you merge a big
So when it &apos;s somebody in a us very powerful , we tend it shrink the . , we don &apos;t the same thing , what they .
I &apos;m observe this behavior in class , and what I noticed ? &quot; &quot; And I noticed that the students MBA
When they become established , so like will spread .
And then you have other people who are basically s , when they &apos;re going . You see that now , like they &apos;re going .
In this , I saw a couple of things .
It &apos;s much more likely to do something that the women , not men .
Women are long term feel less powerful than men , so it &apos;s not a surprise . But there &apos;s another thing that I &apos;ve noticed is , &quot; &quot;
This is in the classroom MBA very important , because the activity on hundreds of hours of creating half grades .
Business schools struggle with this gulf between the grade of both sexes in the same individual .
So I started thinking about it . &quot; &quot; Do you have that all these people .
Well , there are some evidence .
For example , we &apos;re smiling , when we &apos;re happy , but also , if we &apos;re making to smile , by holding pen like this between teeth , causes that feel happier .
So it &apos;s a two-wayed . And with the power of &quot; &quot;
The second question was , &quot; &quot; — we know that our minds are changing our bodies — but is true that our bodies are changing our minds ?
And when I say minds in the case of power , actually I &apos;m talking about ?
What do they look like mind powerful versus think &quot; &quot;
People with power tend to be , not surprisingly , andset and robust , more optimistic .
They have a feeling that you play in the gambled games .
So there &apos;s a lot of the differences . That &apos;s risk .
But in fact , it &apos;s power &apos;s also about how you respond to stress .
You are somebody who wants impacted a leader , who is dominant , has a high testosterone , but strongly under a stress ?
You probably don &apos;t , right ? You want person ,
So we have both evidence . So that the body can shape mind , at least at the level of the faces , and it &apos;s that change role can shape mind .
So what happens , if you let &apos;s to a new role , what happens if you do to really at least level , like this tiny manipulation , like this tiny intervention around ?
Here &apos;s some others .
So you can stand or even sitting .
Here &apos;s attitudes signaling a little power .
They &apos;re , you &apos;re doing is small .
When you touch the neck ,
So it &apos;s like this . &quot; &quot; The ,
That was it . That was the experiment .
The testosterone , we discovered this .
So again , two minutes , and you can get these changes .
&quot; The cortisol , this happens . People traineding &quot; &quot; might &quot; &quot; attitudes . &quot; &quot;
It seems so that our non-verbal manifestations of control it , so it &apos;s not just the seconds , but also us .
It also our bodies are changing our minds .
We think that this particularly as you could use it are social situation rating . Where you value
Again , this is not about , like you speak for other people .
It &apos;s talking to myself . &quot; &quot; What you &apos;re doing before ,
So that &apos;s what we wanted to test this .
It took five minutes . On playing them .
&quot; Five minutes , and it &apos;s nothing worse than if they &apos;re disturbing you .
People hate it . It &apos;s something that Marianne Lans called &quot; &quot;
&quot; Then he looked at those recording four code . &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t recognize hypothesis . Don &apos;t recognize conditions .
It &apos;s about performing that to put into speech .
These things . People bringing their true self .
So this leads the effect , or communicate the effect .
So say to them , &quot; &quot; pretend it &apos;s , until it can &apos;t — like &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not .
I don &apos;t want to prove it and still to have a sense that it &apos;s fraud .
I don &apos;t want to feel as a fraud .
When I was 19 , survived I &apos;m very hard in a car accident , .
It happened me out of the car and did I some thermel .
It happened me out of the car . &quot; &quot; I woke up in the rehab facility
I knew their IQ , because I was considered a smart and for overed child .
So I &apos;ve had from college and she was trying to go back .
&quot; They said to me , &quot; &quot;s college completed . &quot;
I &apos;m a fraud .
Will it remain you and you made idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , the fact that I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So I did . &quot; &quot; Five years graduate studied , &quot; &quot;
It &apos;s not feel , but she yes , and I know what it is .
It &apos;s pretend it &apos;s , it can happen .
So it &apos;s changed .
I want to mean to say , don &apos;t fake it &apos;s , until only you can &apos;t .
You fake it until it &apos;s what happens . Okay ?
Rob it until it &apos;s really going to happen .
The last thing I &apos;m going to tell you is this .
Now , this idea of marginal raisestas can lead to a big change to happen .
These are two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
This should you do . Inconfiguring your brain ,
They think of testosterone . It &apos;s cortisol .
Theyp of , so you of that situation leaving with feelings , you don &apos;t show them their true self .
Thank you . ( Applause )
The big creativity . In the time a we need a lot of creativity .
Dilandty . U. creativity is amazingly , absurd , rationally and irrationally strong .
The big creativity can spread tolerance , double freedom , to make education something like a great idea .
( Laughter ) So the big creativity can turning attention to dejection , or to show that deptation is not in place .
The big creativity can do a politicianse orn side unthinkable .
Can you paint it war like tragedy or a .
Creativity is the mimic that she &apos;s onshirt slogans and phrases into our mouths .
Creativity is the pioneer that shows us a simple journey doesn &apos;testuped moral blue center .
Science is smart , but big creativity is something less oftch , the more magical . And now need absolutely magical .
It &apos;s time .
Our climate change quickly , too quickly .
And a big creativity is needed to make , which makes as well : to inspired different thinking with dramatic , creative works statements .
And to guide us from other acting that is going to be full of pleasantly creative tiny .
Here &apos;s one more creative tinyness created of initiative , which I involved that tries to help creativity inspire people to were ecologicaler .
( Video ) Man : You know , rather than a car , I &apos;ll go today on the paths .
Narrator : &quot; &quot; And so he went , and when he went , saw things .
The weird and wonderful things that would otherwise seen this before .
It &apos;s room crib where leg . Theing motocskel .
It &apos;s and daughter separated from the bicycle secrete wall .
And then stopped . She walked in front of him . &quot;
Woman that with him as a child jump through field and broke his heart .
&quot; Sure , since aboutstared a little bit .
In fact , fromstard enough .
But he &apos;s starting to all my old passion for her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ford &quot; &quot; said silence . That was her name . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t speak a word , Guists said . &quot; &quot; That was his name . &quot;
&quot; &quot; I about what happens next to carvan , exactly 300 feet from here .
&quot; Let &apos;s love . &quot; &quot; In &quot; &quot; Ford z running . We ran one leg , and then the other . &quot;
Guests into it hard entered and loveded with rhythmically , while she filmed because she wasr andmatter &apos;s porn- photographs .
Earth is sex for them both .
And they lived together happily ever after .
And it &apos;s all because decided to go in the day on the paths .
( Applause ) Andes Hobsbaw : We have science , we had already debate .
Moral thempertive &apos;s on the table .
The big creativity is required to take everything &apos;s the kicker and did it simple and . &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot;
And for all came together . To inspired the people to people wanted to be by themselves .
So that &apos;s a challenge or plea , addressed incredibly talentated community of TED .
Either we creative against climate change .
And let &apos;s make it right . Thank you .
( Applause )
So , this game is very simple .
Everything you need to do is to read what you can see , okay ?
So , I &apos;ll count , so you don &apos;t have to do it .
One , two , three . Audience : Can you read it ?
BL : Amazing . And what about these ? One , two , three . Audience : This you the dirt .
BL : OK . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) I wish you speaking bra , right ? &quot; &quot; And about this ? One , two , three .
Audience : &quot; What are you reading ?
BL : What &apos;s you read ? There &apos;s no words .
&quot; I said , it &apos;s reading that you see . It &apos;s so ?
&quot; &quot; there &apos;s written , &quot; &quot; &quot; or you &apos;re the blue ? ( Laughter ) It &apos;s true ?
This is what you should say . &quot; &quot; Right ? &quot; &quot; Why is that ?
It &apos;s because that perception is rooted in our experiences .
The brain will take a little information and factors of it for themselves any meaning , which means that we never see what there in the fact is , we never see the information , always we see just what was useful to see before .
That means that in terms of perception , we &apos;re all like this frog .
( Laughter ) We get information , in which creates behavior that &apos;s actually useful . &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : And ! Ow ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) BL : But when things aren &apos;t going to our idea a bit us roll it , right ?
But now we &apos;re talking about sensing .
And perception under mention and determines everything that we think what we know what we believe , our desires , dreams , clothing that we wear , who in love with , everything starts in perception .
So if it &apos;s perception rooted in our past , always fundamentally we deal as much as in the past .
But in fact , it &apos;s a huge problem , because as then we can ever going to see differently ?
I would love to tell you the story about , how do we see differently and about that all new perceptions start the same way .
They begin question .
The problem is that the way questions insecurity .
Well , uncertainty is from an evolutionary point of view bad . If you &apos;re not sure whether that &apos;s it &apos;s a predatorer is already late .
I don &apos;t right ? ( Laughter ) Even sea disease is the implication of uncertainty .
And when you &apos;re in the boat , according to your inner ear moves . Your eyes , because flow resonates with a ship , you say , that you &apos;re standing without the necessary .
Your brain doesn &apos;t know you with this uncertainty and do you wrong .
&quot; And &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous questions that you can ask , because causes insecurity . &quot;
But irony at the same time remains that the only way of as to do anything new is in get in this space .
So how &apos;s even possible do something new ? Well , fortunately , evolution provide answer .
And also allowed us to respond to the most difficult questions . The best questions are the ones that have the largest encyclopedia insecurity .
They &apos;re the ones that study and ask for the things that you think it &apos;s true . I don &apos;t right ?
It &apos;s easy to ask how started life , or what &apos;s a universe , but to ask for what you yourself a true , it &apos;s really the key walk into space .
And what &apos;s a response of evolution on problem uncertainty ?
The game .
Here it &apos;s not just process . Experts into a game they tell you that it &apos;s a way of being .
Here &apos;s one of the rare human withedh , where the uncertainty is basically celebrated . We don &apos;t sure it &apos;s what makes a game funny .
Can adapt change . The making new possibilities and needs collaboration . It &apos;s basically our way social convering to and it &apos;s an internally motivated . &quot; &quot; This means that we play to play . Here &apos;s reward itself .
When we look at these five ways of being , it &apos;s exactly the ways of being that you need to be a good the scientists .
Science is not defined with a method written on paper .
It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is present , and that &apos;s true what is creative .
So if you add to playing rules , you get game ( , isn &apos;t play with rules and . )
And that &apos;s what we called an experiment .
So it &apos;s arms race idea that science is being and the way that the experiment is a game asked whether or not we can the scientists happen every ?
And who else if not 25 , eight to 10 year-old children ?
Because they &apos;re experts on game . &quot; &quot; So I took his bee andrne into a small schools in Devly and goal was not only to be kids saw science different , but to through this process science could see ourselves differently .
The first step was ask the question .
And perhaps had kind of that at this study we didn &apos;t get any money , because researchers said that little kids can &apos;t significantly contribute to the scientific this notion and teachers again that kids don &apos;t manage .
But even so , we looked at it . &quot; &quot; Of course . &quot;
So , here are some of the questions . Theros them decrease , so you don &apos;t have harassing their reading . The main the point here is that the five of questions that children came , were in fact the basic scientific papers during the last 5-15 years .
They asked the on things that are significant for aheaded scientists .
Now I &apos;d like to do is share stage with somebody really special .
It was one of the young people involved in this project , and now belongs between najmladš published scientists on world . When comes out on the stage , become the newest person who ever had a talk at TED .
But science and asking questions is thing courage .
And she &apos;s you , courage , because it &apos;s coming up here and it before you all .
So Amy , will you please come here to us ? &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) Amy help me tell a story about a project Blackawatons bees , but here &apos;s a question that came . Amy , let &apos;s like .
And Amy O &quot; &quot; That &apos;sole : Thank you , Beau . We thought it was simple see the continuity between people and monkey way in which they &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; because they &apos;re like .
But curious about us , if there &apos;s a continuum with other animals . &quot; &quot; It would be amazing if people and the bees thought similar , because look so differently .
And so we asked if it &apos;s possible that people and the bees solve complex problems the same way .
Indeed , we wanted to know whether also bees can adapt new things with using previous toed rules and conditions . So what if bees are able to think as us ?
Well , it would be amazing , because we &apos;re talking about insects on with one million brain cells .
But it &apos;s actually possible that could , because bees , in the same way that we do , they are able to recognize flowerina regardless of time day , light , weather , or angle , the flower to close . ( Applause ) BL : The next step was invent experiment that &apos;s a game . So kids came up with experiment , this experiment , so , game . Amy , can you tell us how it was play and what a puzzle you for bees ready ?
&quot; AndO : The call , with which came out was &quot; &quot;a-tac &quot; &quot; rule . &quot;
We wanted from bees to learn not only come the flower particular color , but to go to flower the one and only if the colored has a certain pattern .
So they got the reward , just when in flown to yellowish flowers and these yellow flowers had blue the edge , or if blue flowers had yellow the edges .
There &apos;s more ways of , in which they can bees learn to resolve this rows . The interesting question is how ?
What was on this project really exciting was that even actually , nor Beau we had no idea if it would work .
It &apos;s a completely new , no one &apos;s never before try , adults don &apos;ting . ( Laughter ) BL : And doesn &apos;ting a teachers , and it &apos;s really difficult for them .
For scientist it &apos;s easy to go without into something that should the idea about what &apos;s doing , because it &apos;s his job in the lab , but for teacher not be aware what happens at the end of the day ... very big because of belong Dave , Studwick , who worked on a project .
I &apos;m not going to go into the details of studies , because you can read it , &quot; &quot; but another step is observing . Here inid we as a few students makes observation . taking where bees fly .
( Video ) Dave Studwick : So what are we to do — Student : fiveC .
Dave Studwick : climbing up here ? Student : Yes .
Dave Studwick : It did not ahead of them eyes . Student : Henry , you can come to help me ?
&quot;BL : &quot; &quot; Can you help me come , Henry ? &quot; &quot; Which good scientist say something like that , right ? &quot;
Student : Here up there &apos;s two .
And here &apos;s three .
BL : So we performed observing . We &apos;ve obtained data .
We broke the simple mathematicals , found an average , and so on .
And we wanted to our findings share . That was another step .
We had them with write and try to their destination . First of all , we had to write , with .
We went , of course , or in the pub . ( Laughter ) That &apos;s on the left is my , &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I explained to them that , you know , these publication live compartmentalized in four different parts : introduction , used method , the results and discussion .
In illuminate what we ask , and why ?
Metom , what you &apos;re doing ? The finding , what you &apos;re observations find ?
And discussion , is about- who &apos;s interested , right ?
That &apos;s in short scientific publication . ( Laughter ) So kids me imposed and I write with in the same place , which means that publication is written of the child &apos;s language .
&quot; I write it I do . I wrote it Amy and her peer . That &apos;s why this scientific publication starts with : &quot; &quot; Once , there was . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In parts about findingss say : Cvial phase , guessh blah blah blah ... &quot; &quot; aaa , &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And in used methods say , &quot; &quot; After we bees put into the refrigerators ( vacake did , &quot; &quot; totler . ( Laughter ) This is a scientific publication . We wanted to make it . &quot;
And this is a previewed page . We have here are just a couple of authors .
All the names of listed here eye type belong eight to 10 year the pupils .
&quot; How &apos;s the first authored basic school in the Blackawaton , because if somebody ever from call this study , used would &quot; &quot; Belakwton and knee . &quot; &quot; , without individuals . And so we sent to Journallu accessible public , which we received to followed the answer : &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I publicationroom outside our atro control qualities , and that &apos;s for a number of reasons . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , this starts words &quot; &quot; Once , there was &quot; &quot; numbers are written intoss , etc . &quot; ( Laughter ) They said that they &apos;re responded . I sente &apos;s &quot; &quot; Purves , of scientific National Academy ( Ga Geographic Academy of Science ) , bigger worldem neurologist , who said , &quot; &quot; This is the most , powerfuled scientific publication I ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; deserve definitely the proper attention . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Learry Malones , an expert on the vision , said , &quot; &quot; The these publication &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; Sal would publishing if it wrote someone adult . &quot; &quot; So we did what ? We sent back publisher . &quot;
And I refused it .
Then we asked Larry ande Hem suffering , to commented on the scientists our findings , was recruited them into biblography , and they sent to of Biologs Letters .
That &apos;s where our story read and value ofed independent of five asers , and published it . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Samoted attempt took four months , but two years until it attempted . ( Laughter ) Typical science , right ? &quot; &quot; And so from Amy and her schoolmates became youngest scientists around the world who &apos;ve ever published article .
And then what was response ?
And the article published two days before Christmas , first day it off 300,000 people .
It was about Tip bossreactor in Science , the scientific-gas me .
And the article is also forever approached in megassly Biologs Letters .
It &apos;s the only free available an article in this Journal .
Last year , it was the other only morey publication in Biologs Letters , they don &apos;t just from the scientists but also teachers and broad section of the public .
Let me read just one response .
&quot; &quot; just , &quot; &quot; I read ( studying ) &quot; &quot;Blak &apos;s what Newtonian bees &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t enough me words for describing my feelings . &quot;
What you &apos;ve done is real , true and amazing .
curiosity , interest , innocentness and excitement for thing are the most fundamental and important predictions for every scientist .
Who else has larger predictions as children ?
&quot; Pleaselling a clap your child &apos;s this team for me . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d his speech is a metaphor of physics . &quot;
I can try it for you ? ( Laughter ) Okay , about , but so . Let &apos;s .
Science is about risking and this is immense risk . ( Laughter ) For me , not for it . Because this is what we &apos;ve done so far only time . ( Laughter ) I love the little you technology , right ?
Shimon Schocken : Yeah , but I love ourselves as well .
BL : That &apos;s the ideal are sum of meaning technologies .
So — ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now we do a smaller a demonstration , okay ?
You &apos;ve got to put your eyes and show you where you hear me clapping . Okay ?
( Holes &#93; ( Hole &#93; Okay what if all of what are there said screw . One , two , three ?
Audience : (Kris ) ( Laughter ) (Kris ) ( Laughter ) We existsco . Now you asking , open your eyes . We do that whole again .
All of us , who are bend over there . (Kris ) Where have the sound coming ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point all this ? The point is what makes us science .
And typically migrating life responding to this situation , but if sometimes we &apos;re going to do something differently , we need to step into the unknown . Whenve opened your eyes , saw the world in a new way .
That &apos;s what gives you science . It offers us the opportunity go into the unknown using games .
I think that true science should people give space on their own opinion and would allowing them this view expressing , that &apos;s why I asked Amy , to ended this talk .
And Amy ?
AO : This project for me was actually very exciting , because it &apos;s revived process discovering and showed me that every , and I mean everyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that &apos;s also a little question can lead to a discovery .
And take someone &apos;s the way I think about something , it can be easy or hard process . That all depends on how we build the person &apos;s a change .
But change the way that I &apos;m over science in was thinking I was surprisingly simple . Once we played game , and then we started thinking about arguka . Then I realized that science is not only boring subject , and everyone could discover something new .
You just opportunity and that my came the Beau and project Blackawatons bees .
Thank you . BL : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
&quot; He writes the year 1800 .
It &apos;s about an anomalous inventions .
This is called the microscope .
It allows see tiny life forms that we don &apos;t see the naked eye .
Doctors pretty soon they &apos;re finding that many of them cause a terrifying human diseases .
Imagine what is in society happen , when realized that English women &apos;s the tea , but the cotyl full of monster . The picture is from London , not far from here .
The 200 years later .
The downloaded the cots is still here , the cows in developing countries tropical of band .
Just the actual malaria causes a million deaths a year . More than one billion people &apos;s endangered different kinds of malaria and needs to go tests .
And it &apos;s light up to these monsters it &apos;s not that hard .
You take staining-inter , and see about field , or fluorescent color or Giems and microscope and you observe .
Each has a face .
Why then Alex from Kenya , Fatima from Bangladesh , Andyoot of the bomby and Juli and Mary of Uganda waiting for months , to figure out what they &apos;re disease ?
Especially because that it would never be enough classic diagnostic devices .
Remember the number of : billion .
The problem lies in alone , microscopes .
And the top of modern science , the microscope , because the accidents for observing on the ground .
He &apos;s actually wasn &apos;t supposed to diagnosis .
It &apos;s hard , big , difficult to maintain and is expensive .
Two my students , Jim and James , to traveled India and Thailand and I were considering this problem .
We &apos;ve given kinds of devices .
In some lens grows mushrooms .
And some people didn &apos;t my functional microscope don &apos;t turn on .
The upshot of this effort and roads was idea to things , which we called the Foldscope .
What &apos;s going on ?
Foldscope is completely functional microscope witho , the field , polarization , projection , all of advanced functions and store &apos;s purely from paper .
So you probably curious , as it &apos;s possible .
So let me show you a few examples and some you go .
It &apos;s becoming one letter of paper .
There are all kinds of panels on thes a functional fluorescented microscope .
It &apos;s three parts : Ooptics , illumination and Clon .
What &apos;s micro-opic , that &apos;s in the promoted directly into the paper .
On paper is not the recipe in any language .
It &apos;s been printed colored code in which , you know , like from the- former microscope .
They looks something like this , and it &apos;s got all functions typical microscope . So here &apos;s a cross desk where putting in samples , that &apos;s here .
This is the new , but all the classiced stains remain on many different diseases .
You can put a sample ,
What &apos;s in this really good and students hate , when I &apos;m going to do that , but still , it &apos;s her &apos;s resilience .
I can it turn on a , about the ground and try to trampled .
He &apos;s even though that is of such a fold of the material that it is paper . &quot;
It also is fun , there we send that normally like regular diagnosticy instrument . But in this way , I &apos;m 30 different pholdscops on different purposes , all in one front .
And one would choose .
This we designed specifically for malaria , because they &apos;re in it fluorescent filters to diagnosing malaria .
So we have special microscopes to an individual diseases .
As you &apos;ve never seen , which you might in this microscope to see .
I would like to show you something , if we can down the lights please . With a pholdscop , &quot; Because we can even to project .
&quot; &quot; I switch off these two microscopes , unders go to walls and I would you exactly what you &apos;ve seen in the microscope .
You &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) This is a cutaway composed a zoom in and when , going through os of , &quot; &quot;
you can see also how lenses are linked in the the birth .
Now you see my favorite insects that like I hate this . The antennas . You see mosquitoes of ps left column .
Mymo here .
Just on the device that I just described .
Can you see how it ray of light bend and translates .
Might we respond to experience ?
Now I give you , very quickly , I &apos;ll say to me , &quot; &quot; because there &apos;s time , how much costs us their production . We make method , roll-to-roll , so on pieces and spending , we spend just 50 cents .
( Applause ) Because we can actually think about what a new paradigm in microscopy , we call it a &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot;
You see a piece of paper
and how we considered new ideas .
Paper has dimensions A4 .
Here are the three parts that I mentioned .
Optical components here are in the top right , we needed to figure out how to make lenses embedded in paper at high the production capacity . We &apos;re harnessing process its self-assembly process and the surface tensions to make andmatic lenses right in the paper .
Sem go lenses .
Here &apos;s resources of light .
Finally , all parts of the basically setting in myself as origami . Because this origami allows on a micrometer accurate optical youlaying .
The other thing we of course tried to evidence that our microscope is resilient , was to come to 3 . floor and drop it down .
Here &apos;s and survive .
Ouring another goal is completely testing terrain .
We &apos;re starting by the end of the summer .
Soon we make thousands of microscopes .
We started to collect data about malaria , Chagas &apos;s disease and gardioize from the patients .
Let me end it with this image .
It &apos;s mind me , but there &apos;s an interesting continuity between practical education and the world &apos;s health .
What tools actually we provide ? Children , that will fight against the co oflu monsters in the future .
Thank you .

So , it &apos;s year5 , I &apos;m in college and with one friend of go on drip of Providence (R agreement Island ) until Portland (Oregon ) .
You know , we &apos;re young and unemployed , so we decide the whole thing solve a sideal travels through national parks , protected forests — with , we &apos;ve selected the longest way , what they can .
Well , somewhere in the middle South Da &#s turning to my friend and I ask her question that I mean for about 2,000 miles .
&quot; &quot; What &apos;s the Chinese character that I still see going ? &quot; &quot;
My friend looking at me with complete empty quarter view .
In fact , Mr. here in front line is perfectly shows her expression .
&quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m explaining her : &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you all the brands that we see with a Chinese sign . &quot; &quot; She just still looking at me , saying , and then there &apos;s because it &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about . &quot;
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m saying is this .
( Laughter ) Yeah , known the Chinese character for the pic eva zone . ( Laughter )
For the past five years of life I deals mentalizing over the situations exactly like this — why sometimes we don &apos;t understand the sign of around us , how we behave when this happens , and we can tell that it &apos;s all about human nature .
In other words , as you heard say Chris , the last five years I deal by thinking about how I &apos;m wrong .
This might seem like strange choice employment , but actually it &apos;s one big advantage : no work competition .
( Laughter ) The truth is , many of us do everything it can to avoid the idea that can go to error , or at least the idea that there &apos;s choice , that we were wrong .
As an abstract concept that everybody can understand .
We all know that everyone in this room makes mistakes .
Humanity in general is errored — okay , okay .
But when it comes to me right now , everything in what I believe , now in this room in the time , suddenly all this abstract assessment , unfortunately , error ideas out the window , and I actually don &apos;t figure out what I &apos;m wrong .
And here &apos;s in this room , so that &apos;s the time in which we live .
We go to meeting in the palan time , you go to family vacations in palan time , in we vote in this room in the time .
So essentially , we all flying life get caught in a kind of trap the small bubbles feeling that in everything we have the truth .
I think that this is a problem .
I think that this is a problem for everyone as personality in our personal and professionalismed , and I think that it &apos;s also collective problem us as a culture .
So , what I want to do is first , talking why we stuck inside this feeling to the truth .
And second , why it &apos;s the problem .
And recently I want to convince you that it &apos;s possible , take out of this feelings , and that if you do this , it &apos;s the biggest morals , intellectually and creatives jump , what you can do .
So , why are we stuck in this feeling of have right ?
One reason is actually something about it , we &apos;re wrong .
I want to ask you something , or actually , I want to ask something you , because you &apos;re right here : What &apos;s a feeling — emotional — what it feels like when you &apos;re wrong ?
The horred , pinging down .
Thembing . &quot; &quot; Okay , great , good .
The horred , palm downs , hambing — thank you , these are great answers , but it &apos;s answer to a different question .
It &apos;s answer to the question : What &apos;s feeling to realize that we &apos;re wrong ?
( Laughter ) Beholding that you &apos;re wrong can be like some of this and so many other things that ?
It could be the devastating , can be like discovery , it can be a fun , like my stupid mistake with a Chinese characters .
But just wrong is not no feeling .
I &apos;ll give you an logical example .
Do you look at the Loony Tunes cartoons ? There , so the breastfet , which is always trying , but never hold the line ?
Almost every episode of this cartoons is the moment where a jot chasing and the at suddenly you run off a cliff , what &apos;s okay , it &apos;s a bird , knows flying .
But the thing is , though , that the jott would be going outside of a cliff right after him .
And what it &apos;s funny — at least if you have six years — it &apos;s that they &apos;s also a perfectly fine .
They &apos;re running on — and to a moment when we look down , and they realize that it &apos;s in the air without land under the legs .
And then falls .
When you &apos;re in something wrong — not when we realize that we &apos;re wrong , but that &apos;s before — we are as the jot . After run out of a cliff and before look down .
You know , we &apos;ll prove them wrong idea , we &apos;ve got problem , but still feel that we have a dry ground under leg .
So actually , I should fix what I &apos;ve said before .
They &apos;s a feeling . It &apos;s feeling like having right .
( Laughter ) So this is one reason , structured is the reason why we stuck in feeling of the rightness .
I call it the blindness fault .
Most of the time , we don &apos;t have a lot of internal provocations , that could say that are wrong , until it &apos;s too late .
But here &apos;s also a second reason why we stuck in this feeling of and this is culturals .
And it &apos;s the star elementary school .
You sit in class , your teacher you given results from the writings , and one of them looks like this .
It &apos;s not my , by the way .
( Laughter ) So you &apos;re here at elementary school , and know exactly what you &apos;ve got to think about the baby , who got this paper . &quot;
It &apos;s silly child , that what makes problems , that what would never &apos; homework .
So in time when you have nine years , the first thing you &apos;ve learned is that the people what they &apos;ll do mistakes are just lazy and unansing I — and in the second line , that the road , as I succeeding in life , is never do no mistakes .
These really bad , we learns really well .
And a lot of us — and I think that , in particular , many of us in this room — with that balanceing so that they become perfecting unitary sections , perfoists , too dream will redefines individuals .
It &apos;s so , Mr. CFO , and astrophysicist , ultra-ma shortone ?
( Laughter ) As it turns out , you &apos;re all CFO , astrophysics , ultra-ma shortonists .
Okay , fine .
In addition , that all we &apos;re angry at possibility , that we &apos;ve done something wrong .
Because according to this , do something wrong , means that it &apos;s something wrong with us .
So just take that we have the truth , because they make us feel like we &apos;re smart and liable and chisting and safe .
So let me tell you a story .
A couple of years ago , the woman comes to Beth Israel Deconss Medical Center for surgeonic surgery .
Beth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
It &apos;s a hospital where medical students come from Harvard , one of the best hospitals in the country .
So this woman &apos;s going to come and take it into operating the auditorium .
Are andnastsia , surgeon do their job — &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a back and send it in the room .
And everything looks fine .
&quot; And waking up and looks at myself down and said , &quot; &quot; Why is it in bandages the opposite side of my body ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , the wrong side its body is in bandages because the operation surgeon performed on her left leg , a place her right leg . &quot;
When Vice President of for quality health care in Beth Israel talk about this incident , said something very interesting .
&quot; He said , &quot; &quot; whatever reason , surgeon simply thought was on the right side of patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point this story is that tooed trust in the sense that we are on the right side of something can be very dangerous . &quot;
This inner feeling the rightness that we experience all so often isn &apos;t trust the guided of what &apos;s really going on in the outside world .
And when we behave so that it &apos;s , and we stop imagine possibility that we get wrong , so it &apos;s the moment where we &apos;re starting to do things like you pouring 200 million-gallons oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or pollination trunk of the world economy .
So it &apos;s a big practical problem .
But it &apos;s also a social problem .
Think about it for a moment , what it means to feel that we have the truth .
It means that you think your beliefs just perfectly match reality .
And when you do this , you have here in solving one problem is that as explain Do you all those people who disagreeing with you ?
It stems so that most of us these people explains the same by turn on a series of unhappy assumptions .
The first thing that usually do when someone doesn &apos;t agree with us is that we assume that it &apos;s aighrant .
It doesn &apos;t have access to the same information as we have we and so when with him generously these information theyth , to see light and are adding to our team .
When &apos;s , and it &apos;s so that these people are exactly the same facts like us and still with us disagree , so moving to another assumption , which is that they &apos;re all idiots .
( Laughter ) They &apos;re all right pieces , and they &apos;re too s left to right you put them together .
And when it &apos;s not that &apos;s when you show that people who disagree with using have exactly the same facts like us and they &apos;re actually really smart , so I will move to the thirdm assumption : they know right , and her to deliberately wind for their own sinister purposes .
This is a disaster .
This attaching to own the rightness to prevent us from mistakes , when it &apos;s absolutely need and causes that we have to treated the core .
But , what &apos;s the most mysterious and most tragic on all this is that it &apos;s comes about the sense of to be human .
It &apos;s like we &apos;ve wanted to be that our minds are just perfectly cleared windows and we of them just looking out and we describe unveiling the world .
We want to make every look from this the same window and saw this same thing .
That &apos;s not true , and if it &apos;s true was , so life would be incredibly boring .
The wonder in your mind &apos;s not that the world you see so , what &apos;s .
But it &apos;s see , what &apos;s not .
We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it was like to be no other person a different place .
And all this we do something different , which is why we &apos;re all the same can look up at the night sky and see this and this and this .
And andńo , it &apos;s also why in things we &apos;re wrong .
&quot;1200 years ago , Descartes said his familiar thing about &quot; &quot; I think , therefore I am . &quot; &quot; This man , St. Augustine sat down and wrote &quot; &quot; Fallore ergon withum &quot; &quot; — &quot; understand , therefore I am . &quot; &quot;
Andguists understand that our ability to something to infect is not some sort of hambating in they in human system , it &apos;s something that we can you lately , or get through this thing .
It &apos;s and suled absolutely a basic thing of what we are .
Because contrary to God , we really don &apos;t know what &apos;s out there .
And contrary to other animals , we are obsessed with trials &apos;s find out .
For me , this obsession with is the source of the root and all our productivity and creativity .
&quot; Last year , for various different reasons , found I &apos;m listening to a lot of episod public radio show &quot; &quot; This the American life . &quot; &quot;
And so you listen and listen to , and at some point , I &apos;ll start to feel that all these stories are about how we &apos;re wrong .
&quot; And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I was lost . &quot;
I became a crazy Lady of wrongness .
&quot; They &apos;s everywhere I &apos;ll be &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s happened . &quot;
But a few months later , I get a chance to make interviews with Ir Glass , that it &apos;s this show .
&quot;po rewarded him this thing . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; No , actually , it &apos;s a true &quot; &quot;
&quot; And in fact , &quot; &quot; on says , &quot; &quot; Hm , that each one episod our show me the same hidden a mathematician . &quot;
&quot; And this hidden a math is : &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s going to happen this thing and it instead of something else happened . &quot; &quot; And here &apos;s just say &quot; &quot; Ira Glass , &quot; &quot; , since this needed .
&quot; We need these moments surprises and thes and wrongness , these stories to work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us — members of audience , listenerss , readers , we that we &apos;re these things . &quot;
We have like so things like- the-s , false traces and surprising endings .
When it comes to our stories , we like , when we &apos;re wrong .
But you know , our stories are these , because our lives are that looks like that .
We think that it &apos;s going to happen one thing . &quot; &quot; and instead , becomes something else .
George Bush thought that when will attack Iraq find a lot of the weapons of mass destruction , free and bring people democracy in high East .
And instead of something else happened .
And Honi Mubaak thought that will be dictators in Egypt all his life , until it &apos;s not too old , or too sick to go , and then the government in his son .
And instead of something else happened .
And maybe you thought to you get older , you &apos;ll have a wedding with your love from high school and for being adding back to hometown , and you &apos;ll together to raise the kids .
And instead of something else happened .
And I have to say that I think that I &apos;m writing properly heart &apos;s a book about things that we all unknownś , for the audience , in which never find toing .
And instead of something else happened .
( Laughter ) I mean , that &apos;s life .
For good for bad , genering these amazing stories about the world around us and then the world turn around and impressed us .
Without insult , but this whole Conference is incredible monument our ability to do things wrong .
We &apos;ve spent my whole week talking about innovations and the progresss and enhancements , but you know why we need all of these innovation and progresss and enhancements ?
Because half of the things that are most mind-trasing and the world-nah using — TED8 — ands .
( Laughter ) Very it didn &apos;t works , right ? ( Laughter )
&quot; &quot; Where is my istpack Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) So again to come up .
And it goes on .
It comes with the next idea .
We &apos;re talking another story .
Will we do next conference .
T &apos;s this particularma , as you &apos;ve heard today — for about a seven million times is reinventing of wonders .
&quot; And for me , if you want to reinventing of wonder , you have to take out of that a little , of the rightness of space and look around at each other and look at vastness and the complexity and the secretness of the universe and be capable to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot;
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Sustainability includes what , where and howls out .
The question that &apos;s important for me , who and why .
I know people , which I pick food .
I want to know how to affects .
I want to know how they affect me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how rely on generosity waters , when they want to earn .
This understanding of these things allows us to experience donations the sea as good , and they began to see as their opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
It allows us to celebrate donations sea that we can afford to eat .
How do we called ?
Prospert donations sea .
Sustainability means ability for persisting and maintain , and the helpfulness is the ability to again and grow .
These food allows create evolving and dynamic system , and reinforces our relationship to the ocean as source , suggesting that we &apos;re trying about reo revival of the oceans , and it &apos;s about encourage their resistance .
It &apos;s more hope , human and , much more useful way of understanding our environment .
Inreck &apos;s the recipes — common thing with a lot of marine protects — it &apos;s useful and a great tool .
Green , yellow and red lists marine species .
It &apos;s very simple : buy green , don &apos;t red , yellow set of you to think of twice .
Well , I think that &apos;s not enough to eat really just the green .
It &apos;s not sustainable , as far as scale of the success will not be change fate species on yellow and red list .
And what if we add kind is just by green list ?
Here &apos;s tuna yellowfining , is c on thedoc — of sustainable &apos;s population .
We &apos;lled inding — no than viadscats .
It &apos;s great for fishermen . Big profit . The support system local economy .
But it &apos;s a lion seas . It &apos;s a top predator .
What &apos;s in the background of this food ?
&quot; &quot; Sa bottom in steakhouse to pounds of porce of this food ?
Three times a week ?
We can be in the green list , but I don &apos;t the kindness or it &apos;s not , it &apos;s not the ocean .
The point is , we have to see correlation , have measureer for ours .
An example : I heard that red wine &apos;s great for my health — antioxidants and the minerals — heart healthy .
Good job ! I love red wine !
I &apos;m going to drink a lot of . &quot; &quot; I will be so healthy .
But how many of these bottles tell me , that &apos;s the problem ?
Well friends , there &apos;s a problem with whitesins .
We &apos;ve lost sensitivity , when it &apos;s food , and we pay for .
The problem is that costs hide under waves .
Hiding those cost for social acceptableness expanding the circuit in the tape .
And hide the costs a huge profits .
First of all , food from group of gifts sea really takes into account our needs .
&quot; &quot; Jaws , Flipper or fishing from companies Gorton &apos;s not the beneficial donations sea , it &apos;s more Jolly Green Giant (z advertising on vegetables . )
Greenina : could save the oceans .
Sylvia &apos;d like to say is that that blue is the new green .
And I with respect argument is that green broccoli could be new blue .
We need to continue to eat the best donations sea , if it &apos;s even possible .
We &apos;ve got their right to eat a tons of vegetables .
Best of group of gifts of the sea , is that they &apos;re served to then , and with bottle Tabasca , and with wheels emotionron .
&quot; The serves 140g you was coverse in disjoishly its and the crisp crop-ined aka , and with a bunch of &quot; &quot;risota &quot; &quot; from quoins with crisp , ilvan of brocco street , and he &apos;s so sweet , and in a woman &apos;s , and it &apos;s wasted on the surface , only with the make a ored . &quot;
Ju of interest !
That &apos;s sell .
The coolest thing about this is that every family has all the ingredients to reach at a local self-ob run .
Jamie Oedavier leads campaign to Americans saved from their way diets .
Sylvia &apos;s leading campaign for saving the oceans from our way diets .
It turns out there &apos;s a similarity .
Forget about a nuclear holocaust concerned about ; the need forks .
He &apos;s weed our planet , and then we geted food used so that we &apos;re even more broken his situation .
So I think our eating is wrong .
I think it &apos;s time that we &apos;ve changed our expectations from food .
Sustainability is complicated , but lunch is the thing that &apos;s all very well we understand ,
So let &apos;s start here .
And that &apos;s happening in the interests of ecoed getting more food .
Dan Barber and Alice Wters dedicatly lead a revolution in an ecological and tased diet .
E ecological diet us often as consumers leads to inducing accountability .
Just because something &apos;s coming from the ecological resources doesn &apos;t mean that to that we can behavelessly .
We have ecological shrimp .
We have the technology to their an ecological production .
But we will never have unlimited ecological sense buffet with shrimptas .
It didn &apos;t work would be .
Food beneficial for heart is important parts beneficial diets from seafood .
Whereas trying of the bottomaring plummeting marine population , the media recommend higher energy fruits sea .
The study say , that &apos;s tens of thousands of American grandmothers , grandfather , I have and his father &apos;s they mighty to get other birthn , if consumed more fruits sea .
I &apos;m willing to give up to this benefit .
But it &apos;s not just about fertils sea .
It &apos;s the way we look at bowl .
As serifs , I discovered that the easiest place , if smallerion , the stuff on our plate .
It became a couple of things .
&quot; We &apos;ve made more money .
People began to buy a curs and lettuces , because they knew that only the main meal they won &apos;t enough .
spent more time over his food , spent more time together in food .
In short , got more than the what arrived , even though get less proteins .
We &apos;ve obtained more calories of disparate meals .
Prospered their health . I &apos;m more save .
That &apos;s delicious .
In each plate , was to served by some matterness to fill this environment , but also big portion matterness to fill with interest from people itself .
The other thing we did : serveing more diverse species — most frequently narrower , and swallow merely ,rins .
Actually , withvas , oyster , different edible you , youed — these most .
So we pusheds to flexible , more beneficial possibilities .
This we need to support .
This recommend green list .
And it &apos;s a possible the beginning againo healing our environment .
But what with these big predators , these eleganty species , with the tunas from green list , which I talked about ?
If it &apos;s for you guys , I &apos;d been recipe .
It works well for any big kind of fish in the oceans , so here &apos;s .
So , you start with 450 s the big fish .
Take a knife . They cut it into four pieces .
Give them in four plate .
So you put these plates a bunch of vegetables and open the best bottle burgundian , what you &apos;ve got to , you with candles , and ova it .
The famous you an opportunity , you can eat .
Invite the friends and neighbors and frompa say it once a year , the eminent .
From the food I expect many .
Life &apos;s health and joy , and family , and society .
Life that preparing ingredients , preparings and their consumeation is part of connection human interests .
I had lucky that my father was a fantastic cooks .
Very soon me overed about privilege , which consumeation food is .
Okay , the thing I remember about is from my childhood .
They were smart portions throughout the protein served with a plentiful amount of vegetables and little bit of starches , usually with rice .
This is the mostly dieting today .
I &apos;m coming to see when I &apos;m wrong , you &apos;reakhouse .
And I &apos;m from it .
It &apos;s like a monkey of protein .
It &apos;s disgusting .
But of all of those terrible news that you hear , and you &apos;ll hear about the state of the oceans , and unfortunately I &apos;ve got to tell you , it &apos;s the worst that all that time was your mother right .
It &apos;ll get you also vegetables .
It &apos;s very simple .
So , what &apos;s in the food we look for ?
I am healthy ingredients that they are good for my body .
And I &apos;m seeks me joy and salt and sexy things , to let food disgusted as a sentence .
And I &apos;m seek family recipes that worshipping my personal story .
For society right to start at the very beginning .
You can &apos;t escape from the fact that everything we eat has global consequences .
I try to figure out how best you know what the consequences are , and then make the first step towards their minimum habitat .
We &apos;ve seen picture of our blue planets , our global banks .
But it &apos;s more than just a pieces of raw materials ; it &apos;s also global geography community that we call the lunch . &quot;
So if you &apos;ll take only &apos;s necessary , about the rest we can start division , we can start to celebrate , we can startt repairing .
We &apos;ve got to sort of bask vegetables .
We &apos;ve got to sort of bask smaller portions throughout the fruits of the sea .
We have to save for lunch .
Thank you .

In 1986 , much more than people started talking about ecological problems and environment , I started paper test tubeoc as building materials .
Tests to new the design files materials are very complicated . This was not much tougher than I had expected , and because it &apos;s an industrial material , easily we can on the &quot; &quot; Igning also do flame-or .
In 2000 was in Germany big exhibition .
I built pavilion of papers the tubes , from recyclable of paper .
The goal of design is not building to finish .
That was the goal of my design .
that &apos;s invisible .
They &apos;re using the most , to they changed their power and money by creating monumental architecture .
So I started to work in crisis areas .
In 1994 was in African of Rwanda big conflict .
The fighted against each other two tribes , Hut and Tutsi .
More than two millions of people became refugees .
what led to a deforestation and ecological to the problem .
So they started provide aluminum pipes ,
&quot; And he said , &quot; you &quot; &quot; My God ! You had gone mad ? !
They like this lived under plastice sails in the park .
So I have proposed to rebuilding them ,
So in 2001 , I also built shelter in West India .
I was asked to I built the temporary church .
It &apos;s still use , even after last earthquake in China .
In 2009 , they had also earthquake in Italian of L &apos;Aquiile .
I designed to head , the character of makeshift mod andy .
After the earthquake and tsunami had to be people evacuing into the great rooms , like the training horse .
But it was really needed .
Now , I work in New Zealand in Christchurch .
Thank you very much .
What &apos;s place in this child mind ?
If you this asked people 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would say , that &apos;s a baby &apos;s irrationally , counterintuitive , egocentric view that can &apos;t take another person or understand cause and a consequence of .
In the last 20 years , balance of science completely make this idea .
So , in some ways , think that thinking this child is like thinking the best scientists .
Let me give you one example .
One thing I would this child could think what could be to place in their mind , it &apos;s trying to figure out what is going on in the mind of another child .
After all , one of the things that &apos;s hardest for all of us , it &apos;s figure out what they think and other people feel .
And maybe the hardest thing of all , it &apos;s figure out what other people are thinking and sense , it &apos;s not actually exactly what it is we think and feel .
Anyone who &apos;s watching politics , can to suggesting how difficult it is for some people understand this .
We wanted to know if babies and little children can understand this profound thing about other people .
So the question is : How do we get their could ask ?
Children yet unable to speak , and if you ask a three-year-old to tell you what &apos;s mind you get a beautiful flowing stream of consciousness about a pos and a birthday and stuff .
So they actually to ask the question ?
Well it turns out that secret was in broccoli .
Bety Rapache , one of my students , and I gave children — we are two dish with food : one meland with raw brocco street , and one meland with latteds .
All the kids , even in Berkeley , like certaints and don &apos;t likee broccoli .
( Laughter ) But then what Bety did was that to tasted food from every dish .
And faced , like her very disgusted or not .
Half of the time treated so that she likets and doesn &apos;t like to broccoli — just like little kid and everyone else normal person .
But half the time , take a pieces , did , &quot; &quot;mmm , broccoli .
It tasteed broccoli . &quot; &quot; Mmmm . &quot; &quot; And then I took a bittep and did , &quot; &quot; &quot; Yuck , ,ts .
It tastedts . Ble , Yuck . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s acting , like it &apos;s what she was the opposite of what they wanted the kids .
This we &apos;re doing with 15 and 18 months with the kids . &quot;
And then they &apos;d her hand , and she says , &quot; &quot; me &apos;s a few ? &quot; &quot;
So the question is : What her gave a child , what the disgusted is , or a disgusted her ?
And remarkable about was that 18-month-old babies , just barely go and talking , her gavets , if like wasts , but they gave her broccoli , as long as its enjoy broccoli .
On the other hand , 15 monthly kids at her long looked , when faced that she like broccoli , as if it couldn &apos;t understand .
But then , what we had been looking at for a long time , they gave her justts , what they thought , there &apos;s got to enjoy everybody .
Maybe there &apos;s see the two really remarkable things .
The first of those is that these small 18-month-old children already found this profound fact of human nature that we &apos;re not always the same . &quot;
More importantly , they felt that they actually supposed to do things , in order to help other people to get what they want .
But even more remarkableer &apos;s the fact that 15 monthly children &apos;s done , indicating that 18-month-old children learned this deep reality of human nature in three months from the age , when they were 15 months .
So kids know more and learn more than we might think .
And this is just one of hundreds of hundreds of studies , and in the last 20 years , that &apos;s showing up .
The question that you might ask is : Why are babies so much to learn ?
And how is it possible that so many learn in a very short period of time ?
After all , if you look at the kids surface is not of them no benefits .
And in many ways , it &apos;s worse , the proto because we spend so much time and energy just to survive .
But when you look at how evolution answers an mystery , why we spend so much time caring forned these children , it turns out that actually there &apos;s the answer .
When we look at the many and so many different kinds of animals , not just in primates , but also other mammals , birds , even on in Osce as theed , and in thebay , it turns out that there &apos;s relationship between how long childhood kind of has and how big are their brains in comparison to the body , and what they &apos;re smart and flexible .
&quot; &quot; And overalls birds this ideas are birds on the screen .
On the one hand , it &apos;s new rockedonn inran .
Inrans and other ppe birds , hatrans , and so on , they &apos;re incredibly smart birds .
They &apos;re in the same directions smart as chimpanzees .
And this is a bird on the covers journal Science , who &apos;ve learned to use tool to get the food .
On the other hand we have our known , withlip of homework .
And chickens , duck , fidds and seas are just silly .
So they &apos;re very , very good in a rhinors , and they are not too good for anything else .
It turns out that calves new rockdoian in defense , stay in nests until operating .
They &apos;re dependent on their moms that drop worms into their little of opens up into their two years , what &apos;s really long time in life bird .
&quot; By contrast chickens to succeed in just a few months .
So childhood &apos;s the reason why end inrans on the cover of Science and chickens in a pot design in the soup .
Longy normal life seems to be connected with knowledge and learning .
So what explanation for that we have ?
Some animals , for example , chickens , seem to be beautifully equipped to good quality perform one single things .
They seem to be be so beautifully equipped to thebing ofrna in one environments .
Other creatures , as they &apos;re in defense , there are actually very good for anything particular , but are extremely good in learning about lawss different environments .
Of course , we , human beings , we &apos;re completely else but in defense .
We have a much larger brains relative to body than itsk other animal .
We &apos;re smarter , adapting , we know more to learn , survive in diversest environments , migration we cover the world , and made it into the universe .
And our children are dependent on us a much longer than children other species .
My son is 23 years .
( Laughter ) At least , until 23 , don &apos;t have them stillhit we worms in those little open mouthos .
So why would we saw connection ?
It &apos;s theory that strategy of learning is extremely powerful , the strong strategy as in the world forward , but she &apos;s one big disadvantages .
The downside is that while you &apos;re still learning , you &apos;ll be helpless .
&quot; So , when you mind mast wateront , you don &apos;t want to think about , &quot;ak or maybe about spear could have . But what of it is better ? &quot; &quot;
That &apos;s everything you want to know more , than to mast wateront ever show .
The way that evolution will solve this problem , it &apos;s a kind of behind the work .
According to this theory we have the earliest period , when we completely protected .
We don &apos;t do quite nothing . Only learn .
And then , in adulthood , we can take everything we &apos;re taught as kids , and it &apos;s used in the real world .
One way to look at it , it &apos;s that children are like separation research and development of the human race .
They &apos;re protected drownist , whose job it is to go out , to learn and to have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
We need to all the ideas that we learned when we were kids , and to make the most in practice .
Another way to look at it , it &apos;s consider kids for fail adults , we &apos;d better take them as another development , phase of the same kind of — something like caterpillars did and butterflies — with the difference that they are the fantastic butterflies , which flying for garden or a study , and we caterpillars did that slowly climbed his sk road adulthood .
If it &apos;s true , if they &apos;re children adapted to learning — and this evolutionary story report that they are , it &apos;s it , that &apos;s predestined by the — we can expect to have really strong mechanisms of learning .
And actually , the brain baby seems to be the most powerful computer on learning on this planet .
Even when real computers it slowly transcend .
More recently , in our understanding of machine learning happened revolution .
It &apos;s built on ideas this gentleman , Reveranda , Thomas Bayesa , statistics and a mathematician from the 18th century .
Bayes provide a mathematical applications theory probabilities on the characterization , the description wayy scientists knows the world .
Scientists processing so that they have a hypothesis that they want to get started .
They &apos;re testing it and the evidence .
The evidence of their a hypothesis change .
And then testing a new hypothesis and so on .
Bayes has shown us a mathematical way to do it .
This math &apos;s really the crux of the best programs for learning machines we have today .
About 10 years ago , I came up with theory that the babies make exactly the same thing .
So , if you want to know what happens behind these beautiful brown eyes , I think that looks like this .
This is a notebook Revern Babye . &quot; &quot;
So , I think that babies actually make complex calculations with conditioned the odds that devaluing , to find out how the world works .
And that seems to be more heaviest task .
Because , even when statistics ask adults , look extremely silly .
How could it be possible that statistics doing kids ? &quot;
And we &apos;re tested , we &apos;re a machine that we called the Bedcket Detector
It &apos;s box that glows and play music , when at her you put the right objects .
So using this very simple machine just made my and other lab dozens of studies show how good are babies in learning about the world .
Just one we did with Tumar of the Rousne , my students .
If I showed this detector , you would you first thought that activates it because it &apos;s that you put the cube .
In fact , this detector works a little strange .
Because , if the cube waves in you over detector , what should you early on certainly mind detector is activate in two of the three trials .
And if you do it likely to put the cube on detector , activate has only at two in six repeating .
So don &apos;t likeed hypothesis is actually have stronger evidence .
It seems that wave is much more effective than the other strategy .
We &apos;ve done it ; put four-year-old kids this pattern showing and asked them to launch it .
And indeed , these four-year-old children used evidence , and she &apos;s an objected over the detector .
Two things are in really interesting .
First of all , it &apos;s mind in that it &apos;s a four-year-olds .
Meanwhile just teach to count .
But they &apos;re doing without realiz complex calculations that will determine value condition-based probabilities .
The second thing that is interesting is that the use this evidence to get some sense , hypotheses for world , which seems to be veryly unlikely .
Similar studies that we &apos;re doing in my lab , have shown that the kids would show up four-year-old only unlike the hypothesis rather than adults who got the same puzzle .
I mean , in these circumstances kids use statistics to knowing the world , but they &apos;re doing because scientists also experiments , we wanted to see if it &apos;s also kids do experiments .
When kids experimenting , we &apos;re talking the testing everything possible , or also that playing . We were published multiple studies that have shown that play is in fact this kind of experimental research program .
Here &apos;s one of the lab Cristne Legare .
Cristly she , used our Blicket Detector .
Like , the kids that yellow activate it and the red don &apos;t , and then showed them anomaly .
Now you &apos;ll see , as this little boy went five hypotheses : in two minutes .
( Video ) Boy : And what this ?
And just like the other side .
Andison Goum : OK , his first hypothesis was refuted .
( Laughter ) Boy : This shineed and this nothing .
AG : OK , out you a notebook with his on trials .
Boy : What &apos;s actuallyss ?
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t .
AG : Every scientist recognize this expression of despair .
( Laughter ) Boy : Ah , because it has to be like this and thiss like this .
AG : OK , hypothesis number two .
Boy : So .
The .
( Laughter ) AG : This is another idea .
&quot; He said the experimenter , to do this , to try to ask to other place .
It also doesn &apos;t work .
Boy : Oh , because light it &apos;s just like that , here &apos;s not .
Ah , the bottom this box has in it electricity , and this electricity doesn &apos;t have .
AG : OK , that &apos;s fourth hypothesis .
Boy : The light .
So when we put four .
Four here , to shinelo , and two here , to shine .
AG : OK , that &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
This is a particularly lovely and artation boy , but what Cristly discovered , is that this is a quite the usual .
When you watch children when they when you ask them to explain something , what &apos;s actually they &apos;re doing , it &apos;s a series of experiments .
Let &apos;s a four-year-old children it &apos;s pretty common .
Well , what &apos;s like to be creation ?
What is one of these amazing butterflies , who can five hypothesis to test for two minutes ?
If we go back to the psychologists and the philosophers , many of them said that the babies and children perceive just by a little bit , if something .
And I think it &apos;s true .
I think that &apos;s babies and children perceiving more than adults .
It &apos;s about , like works consciousness an adult , we know this .
Theority and consciousness adult look a little bit more like light flashlight .
The adult , when you decides that something &apos;s relevant or important , pays attention to it .
Our becoming aware of the things that we &apos;re doing , it becomes extremely clear and living and everything else , were dive into darkness .
And we know it &apos;s also something about how that brain does .
When we give attention , cortex face- lobe , efficient part of our brain , sends signal that &apos;s a little part of our brain going to do much adaptable , face one , better in learning and off activity in the rest of the brain .
So we have a very , very focused , the targeted kind of attention .
When we look at the babies and small children , we see something else .
I think that &apos;s babies and little kids have more lantern perception , than a battery perception .
I mean they &apos;re very bad in focus is only one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at picking the amount of information from many different sources at the same time .
If you look at their brain , you &apos;ll see that they &apos;re flood neurotrans that be incentivized learning and faceness , and restrictive part of you haven &apos;t work .
When we tell that babies and little kids don &apos;t paying attention , actually they don &apos;t know , it doesn &apos;ting attention .
It doesn &apos;t to end all interesting things to them could say something , and watch what it &apos;s important .
This kind of attention , consciousness , would we expected from butterflies that are created to learning .
If we were adults wanted in put into our consciousness child , I think , the best is to imagine new situation , in which we &apos;ve never been — if you fall in love with into someone new , or when we first in the new city .
Our consciousness to then , but we don &apos;t really , so the three days in Paris seem to be fuller perception and experiences like months , during which we go , talking andallys sits from thebie .
And by the way , the coffee , the great coffee that you drink down , actually mimics the effect of child neurotransmitters .
So what &apos;s be a child ?
It &apos;s like to be in love , first in Paris , after three doubled espress .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a great building , but threatened you , that I &apos;clock in the morning , you &apos;ll build with crying . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s good to be adults .
I don &apos;t mean too much to talk to me about how great are babies .
It &apos;s good to be adults .
We can own on strings and to walk across the street .
And it &apos;s right that we spend a lot of effort to a kids thought like we do .
But if we &apos;re going to be like butterflies , have open mind , to learn , to stopness , creativity , innovation at least sometimes , we should start thinking more as children .

And I &apos;m going to tell you a story about how I became battlefields against HIV / AIDS .
This is my campaign — SING .
46664 is a number Mandela asmate on the island Robbin Island .
That &apos;s me and Youssou N &apos;Dour onstage , and he &apos;s .
The next day invited all artists to Mandels left to Robbin Island , where he had press conference here for journalists from all over the world in front of her one-ened a prisoner &apos;s all .
On the window you see bars .
For all of us it was a powerful moment .
That &apos;s when Mandela said the world &apos;s print , that his country eating realed the genocide that immediately after the fall of and separattheaeda in the so-called &quot; &quot; ah . &quot; &quot; Be nations &quot; &quot; a thousand people a day die and that the main victims of it , the most vulnerable s , are women and children .
I &apos;m very affected , because I &apos;m a woman and mother , until I realized that the pandemic of HIV / AIDS like this directly affects women .
This is what I &apos;ve got to serve . &quot; &quot; So ever since I attended on every single action foundations 46664 , if it was possible , and I &apos;ve press conference , interviews , talk and used their status singer , as I promised Mandel , of respects to his a giant an incredibly work that performed .
Nelson Mandela respects the world . &quot; &quot; Nelson Mandela every weighs .
I got to know cutting it into action foundations 46664 .
He was a t-shirt , what I &apos;m wearing now .
It &apos;s tool . I &apos;m telling you that I salt dirna with people who have HIV , with people who live with HIV .
And because it &apos;s basicallytigma , these three . I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about it .
I don &apos;t be a secret . &quot; &quot; I became members of a Treatment Andaction Camppaign and I &apos;m proud that I &apos;m a member so amazing organizations .
It &apos;s campaign in low level and 80 percent members are women , most of which is HIV- oppositeive .
They work in the ground .
They have education programs .
It &apos;s showing on the problems this tigers .
Their job is remarkable .
This is my campaign SING .
Where it &apos;s a SING basically arranging me and about 3 or 4 great people who help me .
The last two and a half years I travel throughout the world . &quot; &quot; I was in about 12 different countries .
Here I &apos;m in the Osloan and takes overm nice , fat check . Here singing in Hongcong and I &apos;m trying to raise money .
This is a Scottish Parliament .
And this is in Edinburgh , I &apos;m with great African child choir , which I love .
Many kids like these axisreed , because their family hit the virus HIV .
I &apos;m so Powered their position , and it &apos;s expanding my horizon .
The message , this program now send into the world , is : by 2015 we want to become witnessed the whole end the transmission of virus of mother in a child .
It &apos;s a very ambitious goal , but I do believe that with political will is to haveable .
Here I build with woman , which is HIV- oppositeive , kicks we &apos;re smiling , because we have a big self trust . We know is that this young woman was medicinal to living longer and could look after the child who give birth .
It &apos;s a prevention at the very beginning of life .
It &apos;s one of the ways of anti- pandemic of AIDS .
I &apos;d like to ended now by telling you a little story about Avelile .
This is Avelile . I wages with me everywhere .
It &apos;s a story I &apos;m talking to everyone , because embodies one of million Irrt because of HIV / AIDS .
Mother Avelile had virus HIV . She died on the disease to called AIDS .
The virus was even Avelile , born with him .
Here is 7 years and does not value more like a-year-old .
In that time , suffered on an advanced disease AIDS and had pneumonia .
And we knew it in the hospital in Eastern Cape and spent with her whole before afternoon , was the gold .
Doctors and nurses were great .
And they gave her very a special nutritional diet and great taking care of her .
The five months later we to South Africa back to Avelile again contacted . &quot;
There was a this change .
I get it that this change you appreciate .
So I &apos;d like to say , anyone of you : If you think every mother and every child has a right to the world &apos;s a good food , and good medical attention and if you believe that millennium development goals by the U.N. , especially goals five and six , should decide enforced all governments all over the world , especially in sub-Saharan Africa , please , stop .

Fifty years ago , in Smetan network , the engineers undercover walking a major subject through abandoned landscape .
With this hoping in the summing the interest in minds people around the world that are projected to become the first , which humbling universe .
You was huge .
And her the tip hiding the silver sphere with two transmitters inside .
4 . October , 1957 was their rocket launched .
&quot; One of the Russian scientists he wrote : &quot; &quot; Are we in front of creating a new planets , which we &apos;ll call Sputnik . &quot;
In ancient days , , explorers , like Vasco da Gama andColumbus had large happiness in exploring the Earth .
Now we &apos;re lucky we have discover universe .
&quot; &quot; in the future we will be the env hitting our joy . &quot; &quot; Are you with snippets of &quot; &quot; Sputnik , &quot; &quot; my fifth documentary film that is almost finished . &quot;
We talk story Sputnik , and the story about what has happened with America .
In just a few days after release , was Sputnik wonderful interesting .
One person made visible month for ordinary people awakened awe and pride about that person finally release object into space .
But by about three days later , the day called &quot; The Red Monday , us media and politicians said , &quot; &quot; and we were believed that Sputnik was proof that our enemies used in science and technology , and we &apos;re now can to hack your hydrogen bombs , to use rockets Sputnik as the intercontinental ballistic missiles .
We distracted a hellhole .
Sputnik shall soon became one of three shattering event for America — historians its employ to Pearl Harber or 9 / 11 .
&quot; that &apos;s called &quot; &quot;ssle gasp . &quot; &quot;
Weaping race , an arms race .
They started space race .
And over the course of the next year the congress fully funded the enormous increase in the number of guns and we &apos;ve gone from 12,500 nuclear guns to 20,000 .
The ones on the Sputnik far away for achieve just increase in the number of guns .
For example , some of of you will remember this day , a 1958 , a nationaled exercise civilianal defense , when tens of million people in 78 cities went underground .
Or survey opinion that found that seven of 10 Americans believed that the quickly and then war and that at least 50 percent of the populations .
But Sputnik &apos;s also out of great change .
For example , some in this room got scholarship on height because of Sputnik .
The support system techniques , math and science — learning as such a — rapidly grows .
And the Vin Cerfs out that Sputnik led directly to AndRPA and to the Internet , and of course NASA .
My document shows free company can be outd those who can use the media .
But also shows how can we change what first looks like a bad situation , in something that was finally very beneficial for America .
&quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; they &apos;re going to be &quot; &quot; was released . &quot;
So in conclusion , I &apos;d like to use moment on the thanking one of my investors : the patient TEDster , Jay Walkes .
In addition , I want to thank all of you .

Thank you , Chris .
Hi . So magic is an amazing way as we would still have a reality , do today possible what science tomorrow turns on a reality .
As cyber-r headman relate elements illusions and science , to tell you the allowed to experience technologies the future .
&quot; course heard about the Google eyeliars &quot; &quot;Project Glass . &quot; &quot;
It &apos;s a new technology . When you measure , through the world around you is widespread about data : names cities , remembers , buildings , one day maybe about the names of strangers who you spend on the street .
This is my inonistic glasses .
They &apos;re a little bit large , it &apos;s even just a prototype .
When you &apos;re through , giving you a little insight to mind a cyber illusionionist .
So to show you what I mean .
We just need the play card . It could be any .
So . And it it , so that we &apos;d recognize it , when we &apos;ll see it again .
All right . Very important brand .
Now let &apos;s it into package , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s begin .
( Music ) Voice : Now , ready . The counting image .
Marco Tempest : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards — deck of cards is made up of the four colors : the heart , cross , and the drinks .
Kares are among the earliest symbols and their meaning liv different be misinterpreted .
Some would argue that four color are the four seasons .
Jar , summer , autumn and — Voice : My favorite -year period &apos;s winter . LT : Yeah , my also .
The winter is like magic . It &apos;s time change , heat it converts in winter , water for snow , and then it &apos;s all it &apos;s gone .
And it &apos;s office is from every color 13 cards . ( Music ) Voice : Each card represents one of 13 stage lunar cycle .
MT : So here &apos;s the , here &apos;s a tide and in the middle &apos;s a month .
Voice : the moon is one of the most wrenching symbols magic .
MT : In a deck of cards are other two colors .
The red and the black , which are constantly for changes of the day and night .
Voice : Marco , I had no idea of that you can do it . ( Laughter ) LT : And is perhaps accident that in office is 52 cards , just as it is in 200 52 weeks ?
( Music ) Voice : If we count all points on the cards in a result is , 365 .
MT : Oh , 365 , so it &apos;s days in the year , so many days is between every birthday .
It &apos;s asked . (-ps ) Voice : It didn &apos;t tell what , because it didn &apos;t .
MT : In fact , it was just on my in six birthday , when I got their first deck of cards and you &apos;ve since I travel around the world , and I &apos;m doing a magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and husbands , even for the kings and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who is this ? MT : Oh , aunct . Look .
Wake up .
I &apos;dler : In . MT : Are you ready to go a ride ?
I &apos;dler : Ready ! MT : So show , what can you do .
I &apos;dler : So I &apos;ll give you my bar to jumping . MT : Yea . Mind .
I &apos;dler : Whoa , whoa , in , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today I &apos;m doing performance for other audience .
For you .
Voice : The called cardsized . MT : Sometimes people ask me how to become magician ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to work from 9 to 5 ?
Okay , it &apos;s not ! You need to train 24 / 7 .
I don &apos;t mean literally 24 hours , seven days a week .
24 / 7 , is now a bit hyperbolic , but to many train . Somebody can say that magic is the work of some wrong superns forces . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Whoa .
There &apos;s always just say , there &apos;s not .
The Germans does notin unin , which is the English nine nine . ( Laughter ) The magic is not so scary . But I &apos;ve got to warn you , if you &apos;re going to play with somebody who &apos;s given cards like this , just don &apos;t bit of money .
( Music ) Voice : Why ? That &apos;s very good cards .
Shan , their mixess is the four 165 :1 .
MT : Yeah , but I think I have better cards . We had statistics .
Voice : I think that you dolo a birthdayk wish . MT : And so us remained just last , but most important of all cards : card with very important brand .
And unlike the everything that &apos;s what we &apos;ve just seen , whether it &apos;s virtually or not . Voice : O called cardsized .
The digitalal MT : That &apos;s definitely the real .
MT : Bye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I would like to show you something that I actually worked .
During these 30-de challenges I &apos;ve learned a few things .
This was part of challenge , something taking a picture of every day in one month .
I never had the courage to found
It &apos;s terrible .
On the contrary , it &apos;s been great fun .
( Applause )
Hi . So I &apos;d like to share with you a couple of things that I &apos;m working .
Since on those work still we &apos;re working , to a large extent we move in the area intuitions and mystery .
I &apos;ll try to write some of the experience that each of these piece &apos;re trying to do .
So the first piece is Imperialed Mohses .
That &apos;s unsuspecting viewers enter into the room and notice those panels , liked composition on a wall .
In a few seconds as if panels notice the present viewer , it looks like that , started sli and reseting a strictly symmetrrically .
( Laughter ) This is a diagram two conditions .
The first is total chaos . The second whole order .
So we wondered , how little you can transition from one state to another .
This remind us a two very different art tradition .
First , there &apos;s aboutary pills of the 15th century , the second one comes about a 100 years . Malevich &apos;s abstract composition .
So let me show you a video .
To give you a sense of the real scales , the greatest of panels that &apos;s about two meters high .
About this much . And the least it is the size of A4 .
So viewers into meesness , and now they &apos;re in attention .
And after a while , if viewers remains in room , panels become against his present in a room themennys , and they get again autonomous again , until they can &apos;t the present or movement , and then again stand up to watch .
( Laughter ) Here &apos;s what it looks like , that viewers like caused order between panels , but it could be a vice versa . Maybe are panels so used onto their pre- intended behaviors , they viewer in the role of forcing tyrann .
This brings me to the quieter , smallerm piece of named Handdheld .
Audiences see a piece of paper located on a wall on the other side of the room , but when you get close , he sees that it &apos;s empty letter A4 or empty letterprint that on each side of keeping two little hands cut from a small piece of wood into the smallest details and with high attention .
Audience sees also that this whole sculpture moves very slowly , like these two hands tried to hold onto paper in place a long time , and they don &apos;t quite well .
So this unstability movement very significantly reminds me of volatility image that we see through ru start camera .
Here you &apos;re going to two footage .
One of the firmly located cameras , and the second of by handy cameras .
And now you can see , like translity of this video shows the presence view and subjective perspective .
So we just eliminated camera and shifting this movement to panel .
So here &apos;s the video . &quot;
We need to imagine other hand . And there &apos;s not .
We &apos;re trying to do but asing gesture self-mas like for this giant piece of paper was someone withst hands .
This is from havinging serve observer and very delictly this piece of paper from them present the observer .
The next piece is Decos .
This is a cardboard model , so the object is about so high like me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; round body , two hands , and a very highs of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; place head , and it &apos;s the only goal is attract attention to themselves . &quot;
So when it came along the viewers , starts to avert from side to side and hands , moving faster and faster , the more viewers approaches .
So this is the first test .
You can see two movements together , and the object is trying to the resolution of despair involved all their being .
The bottom line but is that when attention viewer , it lose interest in starts to find someone else .
( Laughter ) This is finished body Decos .
It looks mass manufactured , like from the factory , like vacuum cleaners or washing machines .
Because we &apos;re working from always very personal space , we like , as this useed aesthetics to some extent deperson out the whole pieces and provide us the same since its appearance .
This is the sameoused being that tries to , to you from the things that your attention really need , but can it be a creature that very needed help .
The next piece is object that &apos;s also a musical instrument .
In shape andmphithestra who is designed to meet a size audience of someone &apos;s on the stage .
So where I &apos;m standing , each one of you looks like this big , and whole audience covers all my visual field .
In audience sitting 996 small characters .
They &apos;re equipped to could from a place of empowerment clapping .
This means that each and every one of them may decide , when he wants clap , how hard , and as long as they want to be aed other or their to influence , and whether they want to participate in innovations .
So when viewers enter a audience , gets response .
It could be weak or strong ( Applause ) , and then nothing happens until viewers leaven stage , and audience again respond .
The ones can be anything from fainted the Applause of several members of the audience or very intense .
So for us , this means that we &apos;re looking at the audience as a separate thing , like own organism that has an almost musical properties , like musical instrument .
Audience on it , what might play you appealing fairly complex and disparate musical or auditory patterns , but it can &apos;t audience directly to elicited to any particular reaction .
Died containing the same rate of the rating , unpredicness and I don &apos;t comforts .
I mean , in a way try and paste .
As you can see , this us quite excited image head divideating to forms two hands .
Here &apos;s a little visual animation , like both side they brought the brain and were trying to understand theality of and tensions .
And here &apos;s the prototype .
We don &apos;t get into Wait a minute , when their we have 996 .
OK , this is the final piece . S called Ferrnners .
It comes from the principle of window .
This is a real window in our study , and as you can see , before it wooden parts of three different latitudes .
So we took the same language window to create own frame , which is hanging in a room that you can see from these two sides .
The tribes with little characters .
It also are three different sizes , to inferred perspective or the distribution of on one &apos;s flat .
Each of these characters can also go forward ora in a  hide and the two go outside .
So unlike this very narrow frame , we these characters they wanted to make aics , almost bizarre , if someone were to take them and physically moved from place to place .
And I love the idea to us these characters jump uped , though their nothing don &apos;t worry aboutil , like they were happy and well-d until you don &apos;t awareness movement viewer andy cover the next of .
For us this piece is something even conflict .
These characters are trapped in this very powerful frame that reminds me of a prison , but also its strength , because it &apos;s nothing to them , don &apos;t worry about it , to be naive and almost didn &apos;t know anything about the world around them .
So all of these characteristics that I &apos;m talking , they &apos;re turned into very specific of technical configuration , and we &apos;ve had the honor at making the first prototype to work with ETH Zurich .
So , as you can see , of our animations eliminated aboutzubing movement and created a kind of movement that involvedations head and movement roll back and forth .
So it &apos;s a fairly small .
You can see that I walks into hands .
So imagine how we got excited , when we &apos;ve seen this really work . Here &apos;s it .
( Laughter ) Thank you !
( Applause )
&quot; And my initialed the conclusion was that that &apos;s simply a better people .
I can &apos;t two people on having worked .
But that feeling of where did it come from ?
That &apos;s personal .
And when we feel safe , so natural reaction was trust and cooperation .
It &apos;s in the night I caning and trust that someone from a guard danger in front of me .
And these forces you don &apos;t have no control .
&quot; &quot; Why is treating with us as a time ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; Why can &apos;t deal with us than the people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; And she said exactly this : &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s that don &apos;t have the fear of their leaders .
It &apos;s not about those numbers .
It &apos;s because violated the very nature leadership .
We violated the deepest rooted social principles .
Great leaders would neverd people because of the numbers .
They sacrifice for us their blood , sweat and tears to vision their a leader , filled . And when ask them , &quot; &quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot;
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up in the Limpopo , on the border of provinces in the Limpopo and Mpumdangs in a little town called Motetema .
Vodable resources and resources electricity are so dotable , like weather . I grew up in these circumstances , and it &apos;s , like , when I was 17 , healed some friends in winter and suned .
The sun in the Limpopo can be in winter , there &apos;s very hot .
Now as you sun , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; Listen , why someone doesn &apos;t think something that just to , at skin , and you don &apos;t batheing ? &quot; &quot; And I look , and I said , &quot; &quot; So would I also I bought . &quot; &quot; I went home , and I did you smaller survey . I found very shocking statistics .
We now has over 2.5 billion people in the world a access to water ands hygienic precautions .
450 million of them are living in Africa and five million of them lives in South Africa .
In environments like are breeding different kinds of diseases , and it &apos;s the most powerful &apos;s called the eachome .
Trasome is aboutal an infection from geeks , which it finds its way into an eye . Morefold infections theomes can lead to a permanent blind .
This disease senses blinds eight million people every one year . Shocking about that is to avoids the infectionsome , you can I washed you face . It no drugs , no pills , no an injection to someone .
who look like secret recipe for an amazing KFC &apos;s .
&quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; the recipe , we have finished .
Now we have to give him into practice .
For we hop four years — after I wrote 40-page business model on my mobile phone , and after I wrote on it also patent , I youngest pe patent in the country , and — &quot; &quot; no buying . &quot; &quot; ) — I don &apos;t have to what to add . ( Laughter ) I made my DryBath , first sk milk that replace buying .
They literally ony on skin , and you don &apos;t have bathe it .
( Laughter ) After I tried it in practice in high school with limited resource , I went to university , I met my few people , has put into practice product and now there &apos;s a fully functional up-and- product that &apos;s ready for listing to market . In fact , it &apos;s available on the market .
So we &apos;ve learned a few pours about tradeing and about how people available Dryth . &quot;
Amongst other things , we found that poor communities don &apos;t buy products at large .
They buy products by needs . People from Alex of allut package of cigarettes , but rather one cigarette every day , even if it &apos;s more expensive .
So Dry &apos;re selling ;th in a differentery ,s .
Just turn them in half and print .
And the best part is that one , how will replace the one bathroom for five wounds .
We make this model , we &apos;ve learned a lot about implementation product .
And we found that even rich kids a suburbs really want DryBath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
In any case , we found that could save on average 80 nice . liters of water every time , when youy bathrooms , and also we could save two hours a day to children who are living in rural areas — about two hours more on school , about two hours more on homework , about two hours more be just a child .
When we understand this global impact , reduced our key claims to clean and comfort .
DryBath is comforted for rich and rescue of life for the poor .
What keeps you ? &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) Now I don &apos;t stop there . Now I don &apos;t stop there .
The other interesting thing that I learned during all over this process . Last year me Google named in one of the mosttaentest person in the world .
Now , I also studies the best business in the world , the first African that got so honors , but the one thing that has really a , it &apos;s that all I did just because they did not want me buying . Thank you .
( Applause )
So with this focusing on lower costs I asked myself , forget the patient ?
It &apos;s a big part of the national &apos;s budgets .
And a lot of different kinds of reforms tries to this growth foring .
&quot; In other countries not consequence new drugs , and therefore they can &apos;t get to patients .
In a few countries are doctors and nurses to some extent  for Parliament .
And fancy decisions in health care then do doctors and nurses .
We would you prefer expensive laboratoryak test , you decide that you &apos;ll operate an old and weakened patient .
So the limiting freedom of doctors can maintain low costs .
Finally , some doctors today , and they say they don &apos;t have a perfect freedom to make decisions , which they think are the right for their patients .
So we went back , and we said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s actually what we &apos;re trying to do ? &quot; &quot;
We call this the health care based on their values .
This was described beautifully in 2006 in a book that wrote Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg .
In this picture , you can see my mother-in-laws with their three beautiful daughters .
If you compare hospital in a country , you discover that some are extremely good , but also you &apos;ll find lots and lots of those that are substantially worse .
The differences were dramatic .
Ho come you coin . 50 percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot of it .
If instead , went into the Hamburg , to the clinic called Martins-K clinic , same thing risk would be a 1 :20 .
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have information .
And often these data or don &apos;t exist .
Nobody knows .
So to go to the hospital is like lottery .
But doesn &apos;t have to be like this . It &apos;s hope .
On the left here you see the variations metal parts , artificial bestder that you used to someone who needs new hip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hmm , we should measure this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No , we should measure this . &quot; &quot;
And since agreed , start with measuring , and they began to share this information .
Everybody saw that that makes sense .
Since then , published every year .
Once a year publish ligation spreadsheet , who is the very best , who &apos;s at the bottom of the ladder ?
And each other visit to learn , so it &apos;s ongoing cycle of improving .
It this principle it seems really exciting .
Doctors come together , the back to what is good quality , they &apos;s measure , then share information , fromist , who is the very best , and learn from .
You don &apos;twined improvement .
But , this is not the only exciting part .
That &apos;s exciting in itself .
So when you look at the story about is plant &apos;s hip , sometime ago , was worked study , where were compared the U.S. and Sweden .
We worked studies , where we focus on data from OECD .
OECD makes once a time studies focus on the quality of care , where they &apos;re finding information in all the male member states .
That &apos;s 20 percent of the budgets up on health care in the country .
We were always the best in the classroom .
But most of them don &apos;t .
But physicians have another thing .
They recognize theing from the fellows .
If a cardiologist else call cardiologist in another a competing hospital and speak about why the second hospital has a much better results , the stories .
They separate the information , how to improve .
It &apos;s measuring and creating transparency cycle of the environment we &apos;re constantly improving to what it shows this picture .
So you might say , well , this is a good idea , but this is not just the idea .
This really happens .
You might think it sounds like sneeze , but it &apos;s not that sneeze , it &apos;s a shortcut .
It &apos;s a shortcut for International of for measuring results in health care .
And next year plan to do eight disease , and a year later , 16 .
Why is that ?
That &apos;s the day I sat a workshop with doctors , nurses , and another career staff and said we &apos;re about child leukemia .
A group discuss how now of we turn quality .
We can measure better than we do that today ?
Disk we how to treat these children , what are the important improvements .
In a room was an enormous energy .
It &apos;s many ideas and so many enthusiasm .
looked at the group and said — first picked up a hand , I forgot — raised their hand , they &apos;real a group , and then he said , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot;
Thank you .
I &apos;m really excited to be able to tell you about a few really surpriseing findings for the what brings companies success and that factors have in the success of startups largest weight .
That &apos;s what I wanted to figure out .
First of all , the idea .
I used to think that idea is everything .
One of our first successes Citysearch came , when people wanted to the website .
&quot; Go.com that we reported to TED in 1998 , came , when companies are looking for effectively increase visits .
that &apos;s a great idea , great the timing of .
YouTube at the beginning had no business model .
And the best way to find the right , it &apos;s look at it , or are consumers really ready to what you want to offer .
Very thank you , you &apos;ve been a great audience .
( Applause )
So I went to share with you my photographing .
Or it &apos;s not photos of ?
Because this is of course picture that with his cameras don &apos;t .
Despite my interest in photos of started , when I got the first digital camera in 15 years .
It &apos;s you , it &apos;s with my earlyed passion for painting , but it &apos;s a bit different , because by using camera , the manufacturing process is in planning .
And when you do with our cameras photograph of process ends , when presses the person behind the trigger .
I felt like photos of was more about to be at the right time and the right place .
I got the feeling that could do anyone .
So I wanted to create something different , something where process begins when presses the person behind the trigger .
Fos like this : work to busy journey .
But it &apos;s of short .
And yet it &apos;s as a certain level of reism .
Or photos like this — the dark and colorful , but all with speak a common goal keep level of reism .
When I &apos;m talking aism , I mean photo-realism .
Because it &apos;s of course it &apos;s not something you normal could capture , but always want to it looked like , that &apos;s some way could be captured like the photograph .
Fos , where you &apos;ll need moment to revealed the trick .
So it &apos;s more about represents idea than about represents moment .
But what &apos;s trick is used that it looked realistics ?
It &apos;s some details or colors ?
It &apos;s light ?
What makes the illusion of ?
Sometimes it &apos;s an illusion of perspective .
Finally , goes about how we interpret the world and as can be caught on two-dimensional surface .
In fact , it &apos;s not about what &apos;s real , it &apos;s about what we think it looks realistic .
So I think the basics are pretty simple .
And it &apos;s just , I see as puzzle reality , where you can take a different parts of reality and put them together so that you create an alternative reality .
I &apos;ll show you a simple example .
We &apos;ve got three perfectly imagined physical objects , that are us a three-dimensional world very well-known .
But when their combine certain ways , can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could be .
But also , we know that can &apos;t .
So we &apos;reed our minds , because our brains simply don &apos;t accepting the fact that it actually doesn &apos;t make sense .
And the same process I see also combineing images .
It &apos;s really just the mixing different rest .
That &apos;s what makes photographs realistic , , for me , are the things that we don &apos;t think it &apos;s not , things that surround us in our daily lives .
But when you combine photography , it &apos;s very important to take on it about , because otherwise it &apos;s just looks some wrong .
So I said , that there are three basic rules , how realistic achieve the outcome .
As you can see , these images are not very strange .
But when you recombining , can create something that looks like that .
So , the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
Second , combined photos should have the same kind of light .
And these two images both those conditions fill up withing — in the same altitude and the same light .
A third is about to do so that it &apos;s impossible to recognize , where different images start , and end by transition will be are vertical .
&quot; He couldn &apos;t tell you how picture actually was created .
So adapting color , contrast and I move on shores between different images the future by adding photographic effects like depth sharpness , tenurated color and noise , blur the boundaries between various images , and it &apos;s going to look like one image , yet one image that can contain basically , hundreds of layers .
Here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) Somebody could think that it &apos;s just a picture countries and changed &apos;s just the bottom time .
But this picture is in fact all folded of photographs of different areas .
Personally , I think that &apos;s easier than to find a place to build it , because then you don &apos;t have to do trade-offs with ideas that you have .
But it &apos;s a lot of planning .
And so , I got this idea in the winter , I knew that I have a few months , the planning , for finding different locations for parts , from which will image .
So for example , this fish was taken to go fish .
&quot; &quot; This are you from different locations .
The recipe of was captured in stoneols .
And yes , even a house on top of island to colored in red , to look more Swedish .
So , to get to the realistic outcome of a , you have to , I think , particularly plan .
You always starts sketch , ideas .
And then it &apos;s about the mixing different images .
And here &apos;s each and every piece of very well planned .
If you &apos;re doing a good job to makeed photos , then can be the result of a beautiful , and also very real .
All the tools to do this are there , and the only thing that limits us , is our imagination .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : Welcome , Julian .
They say that WikiLeaks , your baby , in a few the last years posted more classified documents than other world media together .
Is it even possible ?
Julian Andssanage : Yeah , it &apos;s even possible ?
There &apos;s fear that the rest of the world &apos;s media doing a bad work that one a small group of activists is able to post more information this type , than all the press in the world .
CA : So how does this work ?
As humans , post the documents ?
And as you &apos;re protect their privacy ?
JA : It &apos;s , if we know , classical to bring . And we have for them many ways of information to get to us .
We use modern encryption to actually transport things to the Internet , they &apos;s feet , and we &apos;re using legal jurisduction , like in Sweden , and Belgium was , to achieving the legitimate protection .
Information we get email , a common mail , encrypted or not , for believe them as a two- press agency , the format of them — which is sometimes a hard thing to do when it comes to a giant database of information — post them to the public , and then it &apos;s a fights &apos;s inevitablable legals and political attacks .
CA : So you &apos;re trying to deliver that documents legitimateed . But , in fact , almost never know identity source .
JA : Yes . We know it very rarely has . And even when it into know , so the information destroying the earlier .
( Anving phone ) Sa hell .
( Laughter ) CA : I think CIA asks the code for membership when at TED . &quot; ( Laughter )
So , take the example .
This is something that you &apos;ve made a few years ago .
If it shows ...
So this was in Kenya a few years ago .
You can tell us what you &apos;re made and what happened ?
JA : This is the report agency Kroll .
It &apos;s a secret news information services that you &apos;ve ordered Kenyan government after the election in 2004 .
A year ago in Kenya4eigned Daniel andrap Mos about 18 years old .
It &apos;s a subtle dictator .
&quot; And when the Kibki got some power — because of theitions forces that have tried to take out in Kenya corruption — ordered you this message , and paid for her , and one of the messages , two million pounds .
And then they got the government , and they &apos;ve used to political pressure on Moy , who was still there , the rich , and I &apos;m a man in Kenya .
It &apos;s the holy grail firm to journalism .
So here I was in 2007 , and we &apos;ve managed it hold just before the election — 28 . December .
Well , we publish the three days after , how a new president Kibki decided to get together with the men , who wanted to get , Daniel andrap Mos . So this news has become a burden for President Kibki .
CA : And to cut a long story short , theness about this messages in Kenyan of official , but there &apos;s indirect . And your view it influenced choice .
JA : Yes . We find on the front side of the Guardian and then in all countries neighboring with Ke mold , in the tentzaian and South Africaic printing .
And so the outside of received in .
And after a couple of days to write about it without fear could they press .
20 days ran in a firm television , and by firm to information services affected 10 percent voices that changed the results of voting .
CA : So your occur really significantly changed the world ?
JA : Yes .
( Applause ) CA : And now you &apos;re going to play a briefly excerpt from this videom into the Baghdad .
The actual video is longer . But here &apos;s a little clip .
It did tells , it &apos;s a compelling material .
&quot; &quot; S : ... as their strengthsari , shooting . &quot;
I see goal , the car , about four terings , h , with ...
Can you . OK , shooting .
Take know to their it gives you . They . &quot;
And it &apos;s on me to them .
Well , to love !
(reice of machine guns ) Theyj . Theyj . (reice of machine guns ) They . &quot;
Hotel ... &quot; &quot; The kids two-ness , &quot; &quot; The kids two-ness , &quot; &quot;
to go , now !
Okay , what we &apos;re all eight the person .
I see two birds (ing helicopters ) and still shooting .
Roger , I &apos;ve got them .
Two-s , here &apos;s two-s , go .
Oops , perdon . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s been ?
Sar , Kyle . Okay , hahaha , I got them .
CA : What &apos;s had an impact ?
JA : The people who worked on it strong .
We ended up toying two people to the Baghdad , to about found more .
This is just the first of the three attacks that &apos;s happened .
CA : this attack 11 people died , including the two employees Reuters , right ?
JA : Yes , Two employees Reuters and two kids were wounded .
And there were killed 18 to 26 people .
CA : And occur this prompted general outrage .
What do you think was the key element that actually sparked the outrage ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I think people can see the disparit forces .
You have people who relax go down the street and then a helicopter Apache , the kilometers shooting from them 30-millimeter charges after all , looking for the memory , and kills people to protecting wounded .
And there were two journalists who obviously they weren &apos;t stops , because this is their work .
CA : And American andt secrets service , Bradley Manning , was arrested . And in looking to admit that give you this video with 280,000 secrete telegrams the U.S. Embass .
He did that ?
JA : The up we accept those telegrams .
About five days ago was accused from reaching 150,000 telegrams and releasing the 50 .
In the early 200 we publish the telegram U.S. Embassy , in Reykjavi . But it with necessarily &apos;s disconnect .
I was known visit the embassy .
CA : If you get thousands of diplomatical telegrams the U.S. Embass ...
JA : The public we would changed . &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; ? ) JA : Yes . ( CA : Why ? ) JA : Because these things revealing real state , for example , the Arab government , their real abuse human rights .
If you look at the fromcovered telegrams , there &apos;s these materials .
CA : So let &apos;s a little bit more careful .
More generally , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is right to support making them public classified information ?
JA : There &apos;s the question , what information is the world &apos;s important , and how information can make changes .
There &apos;s a lot of information .
So when organization investing in toing some information , it &apos;s a good sign , that when information gets out , may be helpful . Because organizations that know them best and that know them from inside , you put effort , to their toed .
And that &apos;s what we found from practice . &quot; &quot; And so it &apos;s the essence of journalism . &quot;
CA : But there &apos;s risk , whether it &apos;s for an individual person , or the entire company that escape may have unintended consequences ?
JA : The anything that we &apos;ve made it , we didn &apos;t .
We &apos;ve got their principles protection .
We have a way to store with information that contain personal — the information about a particular person .
But there &apos;s fair secrets — like your medical record , that are fair secrets . But we is we deal with to hangers who are well motivated .
CA : So there &apos;s a good motivation .
&quot; CA : What would you say , for example , the parents , which — son serves in the U.S. military , and which says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;re made something that someone wanted to release . &quot;
( Video ) shows American soldier who laughs , as people die .
That raises the sense in millions of people around the world , that American soldiers weren &apos;t fairly .
&quot; That &apos;s not true . My son isn &apos;t . How da you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say ? &quot;
JA : That we hear quite often .
But remember that people in Baghdad , Iraq , Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see &apos;s a video ; they &apos;s see every day .
So it doesn &apos;t change their opinion . They don &apos;t &apos;s their impression .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
They &apos;s impression and opinion people who for everything pay . And that &apos;s our hope .
CA : So you have figured out a way to light up on things that you would see as aing the secrets of companies and government .
The light &apos;s good .
But you can see the iron that to you in to light up , you musting themselves to their resources ?
JA : Even not . We have no WikiLeaks dissidents .
We don &apos;t have the resources that are dissides against other sources .
If this was discovered , it would be a complex situation for us . But news we to people had felt moral obligation to continue to our mission , so you &apos;re not broken .
CA : But what would interest , just on what we &apos;ve heard — I &apos;m curious to view in the audience TED .
You know , there might be moreered opinions on WikiLeaks and Juliaa .
For example , it &apos;s hero , which bring us important light .
Or dangerousaker , an .
Who thinks that &apos;s hero ?
And who that is a dangerousaker , an ?
JA : Well so . Somebody sure is .
CA : They &apos;re soft , Julian , softs .
We have more to do . &quot; &quot; And they &apos;s another example .
Here &apos;s something that you &apos;re still doesn &apos;t believe the right now , but you do for TED .
It &apos;s fascinating story that just became , right ?
&quot; What is that ?
JA : This is an example of what we &apos;re doing about every day .
So last year — in November last year — was a series of eruptions in Albania , as was explosion in the Gulf of Mexico , but not so big .
And we got a message — something like technical analysis of what happened — to say that protects the audrenal oil companies there fored trucks and dispos them into the air .
And that &apos;s involved and part of albian government , and so on , and so on .
And this technic news didn &apos;t have anyhead . So that was for us extremely hard document .
We couldn &apos;t verify it , because we didn &apos;t know who he wrote it and who knew what &apos;s .
So we were skeptical , whether it &apos;s not a play a competing oiled society .
&quot; So , we &apos;ve made and said , &quot; &quot; this things we have doubts . &quot;
I don &apos;t nothing , but what can we do ?
&quot; materials , operates good right , but we can &apos;t verify it . &quot; &quot; And we got letter just this week from company , which he wrote it , and they wanted to track down resource . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; We want to find source . &quot; &quot; And we &apos;re from said , &quot; &quot; Tell us more . &quot;
It &apos;s like documentary &apos;s just you say ?
You can tell us to show that you have a lawed right ?
&quot; It really your ? &quot; &quot; So we sent this slide of screens with author in identifier applications Microsoft World . &quot;
Yeah .
( Applause ) This happens a lot .
This is one of our method identifiation — testing material . That &apos;s how we find people who the leaves they &apos;re writing .
CA : You &apos;re information from the inside BP ?
JA : Yeah , we have their enough , but I don &apos;t we solve seriously financial and technical things .
So we &apos;re in the last couple of months , a little reduce published , while we create the system for a phenomenal interested in public .
That &apos;s problem .
As each nurturing startup organization , we just overwhelmed own progress . &apos; What it means is that we get the enormous amount of very important information from the bears , but we don &apos;t have enough people to them with modern world .
CA : So this is the hurdle all journalistan volunteers and / ; or funding journalistan pays ?
JA : Yeah , and trusts people .
We &apos;re organization that it &apos;s hard to develop quickly because of a kind of material that we &apos;re working . So we &apos;re a we restructure naturalize to have people who will work on questions national security , and then the less serious things .
CA : Tell us something about themselves , and about how you &apos;re getting to that .
I think I read that as a child you &apos;re going into 37 different schools .
It could be true ?
JA : Well , my parents were in the film industry , and escaping a section , so the combination of these two ...
( Laughter ) CA : Psychoologist might say , it &apos;s a formula for paran developments .
JA : What , film industry ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : &quot; &quot; And you also were , the hackers and almost you turned with authoritys .
JA : Well , I &apos;m a journalist .
You know , I was very young journalist and an activist
I was cover magazine , and for him to me as a teenager investigated .
&quot; So you have to be careful with the word &quot; &quot;hacker . &quot; &quot;
It &apos;s a method that can be used in various different ways .
Unfortunately , that &apos;s are most us in the Russianian mafied to steal the bank in your grandmothers .
So this phrase is not to as nice as I used to be .
CA : Certainly I don &apos;t think you steal bank the grandmother &apos;s not . But what your basic values ?
You can tell us to suggest what are the and maybe some incidentt in your life , which toed for their intendia ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure about the incident .
But fundamental values : able , generous people victims , they don &apos;t take care of them .
And it &apos;s something from my dad and something from other capable and generous people who have been in my life .
CA : Schoping , generous people victims ; they don &apos;t take care of victims ?
JA : Yes , I see person , so take care of people don &apos;t know . But some way — There &apos;s a different way of der about victims , and it &apos;s to punishsers of crime .
And it &apos;s something that I &apos;m in their constitution for a long time .
CA : So we quickly tell one more story : what happened to Island ?
Something you publish the there , they find themselves in trouble with bank , and news services there ban publishing it .
Instead , published your side .
So you &apos;ve Island high profile . What happen then ?
JA : Yeah , it &apos;s a great case .
Iceland walking financial crisis .
It achieve their worst of all countries in the world .
Their bank sector was 10 times larger than the GDP of the rest of the economy .
The publiced this message in July last year .
&quot; And the state television got ban post it five minutes broadcast . The as in the film , discovered on a table , and moderator messages said , &quot; &quot; is still didn &apos;t . What do I do now ? &quot; &quot;
So instead have shown website broadcasting all the time . &quot; &quot; And we got the Island very famous , we walked in Iceland and talk about it .
In society for did feel that this can never happen . &quot; &quot; And the result of that was that together with some sland friendships politics and other international legals experts built a new laws for Island to become habitats for free press , with the most stronger as journalist &apos;s protecting the world &apos;s a higher price point with Nobel Prize honor to freedom of expression .
Iceland is northn country , so , as in Norway , there &apos;s possible to enter into the system .
And just a month or slandian Parliament lawsy passed .
CA : Great .
( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
And when you think of the future , think it &apos;s more like that Big jurther will have more control , more secret , or the other way , we &apos;re going to actually on Big jurther , or it &apos;s everything finally differently ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s go .
There &apos;s a huge amount of pressure for coordinating laws of freedom a word and transparency around the world — part of the E.U. , between China and the United States .
How &apos;s going to evolve ? That &apos;s very hard to predict .
That &apos;s in today &apos;s very interesting . Because it &apos;s only a small ing we can move one or the other direction .
CA : I think I &apos;m going even viewers , when I , Julian that to be careful and you &apos;ll say a lot of forces .
JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
There &apos;s boy who look at my father , and says , &quot; &quot; Dad , when I grew up , I wanted to be by the former President . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) How the former President I was very lucky , because I had an opportunity , what had just little people in the world , to know the number of people around the world .
Not only that , I know 50 states in the U.S. , but with my wife I visited more than 145 countries around the world , and Carter Center constantly working with 80 nations the Earth .
So our perpetual commitment in Carter Center is to support human rights , and I know , I know the world like I can tell you without weighting say that the number one in violating human rights abuse on Earth is women and girls what , who know why , we don &apos;t talk a lot .
( Applause ) It &apos;s a few reasons why it &apos;s going on , and I &apos;m going to start with them .
The first of them is wrong interpretation of religious , a sanctuary sciss , the Bible , Star law , New law , the Koran , and so forth , and these are wrong you founded men who are in significant positions in sonagorgas , churchs and a mosques .
And they have to put these rules to provide that women are confidently in the eyes of God , from harassed on the side of the rail compared to men .
This is a very serious problem . But it &apos;s enough .
Many years ago , in 2000 , I was South the Baptist whole 70 years old — still teaching every Sunday Sunday school ; in Sunday also I &apos;m going to learn — South convention baptists right in 2000 decided that women have just be the nexton roles , in undervi registration against the man .
So attempteddirection , which basically preventing women to become the priests , pastor , dekans in churchs , or cap plans in the military , and if woman leads the classroom in a seminar of South Baptist , can learn , if it &apos;s in room a boy , because in the Bible rows are , &quot; &quot; in the Bible is over 300,000 lines that say that the woman should have to teach a man and so on .
And the main thing is that sacred script are misinterpreted , to maintain men in the heading position .
It &apos;s ubiquitous problem , because men think they can you imposed this power and if thick husband or employer , for example , wants under it &apos;s women , it can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of God , why would I get to them I behave as they equal ?
&quot; Another very relevant disaster , which causes this problem , it &apos;s excessive exposure to us , and that is an immense has been increasing rate of around the world .
For example , in the United States we experience the enormous increase abuse of poor people , mostly black and minority , who were closed into the prison .
When I was administration Goveringer &apos;s Georgie , one of 1,000 Americans sat in prison .
It &apos;s now in prison 73 people from 1,000 .
That &apos;s 7-fold increase .
And since I left B White house , 800-percent reductions has increased the number of black women in prison .
We &apos;re the only from developed countries where it &apos;s still true death sentence .
And we are right next to the countries that are the most ex all forms of human rights , by supporting death sentence .
We &apos;re in California , and recently , I found that California married four billion dollars to execut death sentence in 13 people .
When you do the count , California pay 307 million dollars for the make one person .
Nebraska this week passed the lawated criminal punishment death , because it &apos;s so expensive . ( Applause ) We &apos;re seeing that violence against the poor and helplessed people &apos;s another reason for rise abuse of women .
I want to give you just a couple examples that most frozen , and I &apos;m going to brief , because , as you know , there &apos;s only a limited time : &quot; &quot;
Abs it &apos;s women &apos;s fear .
Women &apos;s theia is cruel and most American women the unknown , but in some of the countries , in many countries when born into a girl , at a very early age her so-called &quot; &quot;cter &quot; &quot; completely paragraphsed genie brit of in nonstered environment , remove the external parts of female genitalia .
And in some extreme , but not rare , cases , open a girls , &quot; &quot; to justing or menstruaing .
&quot; And later , when married , it &apos;s coming again atter &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; open to her ens could have sex .
It &apos;s not even the rare case , although it &apos;s in many countries againsted .
In some countries it &apos;s more than 98 percent of women that were this maimed before the age of adulthood .
This is a severe crime on all the women that living in these countries .
Another abuse , which is in severe rise , it &apos;s murder of honor , caused by bad interpretation , again , a sanctuar writing was — in the Koran isn &apos;t nothing , what would to this encouraged — where family to prepare girl from the family , if was raped or if married to a man she doesn &apos;t , whichated father , or even when it &apos;s appropriate clothing .
And this do members of her own family , so they become in murderers , if girl on family imposs so-called &apos;s shame .
In Egypt U.N. sometime ago , was doing analysis , and that show that 75 percent of these in girls doing father , uncle or brother , but 25 percent of those in do the women .
The other problem in the world that concerns mostly women , is slaveculture , or business with people , as it &apos;s called today .
The Africa to the New World for its about 12.5 million people in slavery in 18 and 19th century .
Today lives in slavery 30 million people .
The Ministry of the U.S. State now got , thet from Congress to once a year was presented in a message , and the Ministry ofins that 800,000 people every year through international boundaries for into slavery , and of those from is 80 percent of women that are sexual slaves horses .
In this moment in the U.S. 60,000 people live in slavery .
In Atlanta in the state of Georgia , where it is Carter Center and where I teach at Emory University , every month for 200 — 300 people like female slaves .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s the first place in the United States .
Atlantic has the largest airport in the world , and it &apos;s also a lot of passport loads , they &apos;re coming from South hemisphere .
If you want the owner a messy place to buy a girl with brown skin , or a black , it can get it for 1,000 dollars .
Girl with white skin brings more than 7 times as much and the average owner a messy place in Atlanta , and the United States today can earn also 35,000 dollars a slaves .
He with sex in Atlanta brings more than all the drugs trade in Atlanta .
So that &apos;s another very serious problem , and the main problem is prostia , because in America doesn &apos;t exist only the brideiner who don &apos;t know , local official , police officers , a police boss or mayor and so forth .
And that leads to one of the worst problems , which is that women are increasingly buyed and sexually introed in all of the countries of the world .
Sweden has to do good approach .
About 15 to 20 years ago , Sweden willing to change law , and women that are in sexual of slavery , are no longer with , but withed are I choirs dels , passports , and the manly customer , and — ( Applause ) — the number cases prostitution decline .
In the United States , we have exactly the opposite approach .
And everybody &apos;s a man tot blowing up for illegal trades with sex seems in the U.S. 25 arrested women .
Canada , Ireland , Sweden , as I said , France and other countries are now toward to this of a Swedish model .
That &apos;s also one of possibilities .
In this country we have two great institutions that all admire : our army , and our great university system .
In the military , just analyzing , to many sexual attacks in it happens .
The last message that I have , that says it &apos;s 26,000 sexual attacks that have become an army . 26 thousand .
It &apos;s them withed only 3,000 , something over one percent , and the reason is , the Comman of any organization — ships like my submarine , or the Bataliion in the military , or crew , a mariners — Comman has lawed right to decide if this violent with , or not , and of course , the last thing that want to , it &apos;s someone knew that under them ineling its of sexual violence , so they don &apos;t keep up .
The law has to change .
About one in four girls that the seconds on American university , facing sexual violence before as degree , and this is a lot of discussion now , partly also because of my book , but also a different , and so 89 university in America was takens from the Ministry of education in terms of law Title IX , because the leading university is taking care about women and letting them a sexual attacks .
The Ministry of Justice says that more than half of rape on campuses high schools do more timesing violent here , because if someone raped outside of university , they &apos;re going withing , but if it makes it to university soils , they can raping needlessly .
These are the manageable .
And these are the things in our society you chronically .
These are things that exists .
In this ladder theest 500 companies is 23 , in which it &apos;s leader woman , 23 of 500 companies , and these CEOs , it doesn &apos;t have to speak , making less than the average of what else directors .
So that &apos;s going on in our country .
The other problem with the United States is the one that we are mostlest nation on Earth .
Since World War II , we have been at war with about 25 different countries .
In some cases , our soldiers directly fought .
Once we &apos;re flying over the heads people and theed them bombs .
Another time , like now , our withouted by the planes infect people .
Since World War II , we have been at war with 25 or more different countries .
They were four years , don &apos;t know that when we — ( Applause ) — when we don &apos;t wasted only bomb , don &apos;t smoke , doesn &apos;t only the rocket shoot a single bullet .
But ones , those kinds of things , exposure to violence and wrong interpretation of it a sanctuary writingm are the main causes abuse of women and girls .
There &apos;s another fundamental reason why don &apos;t have to remember that , and that is , in general is about men do not care about .
( Applause ) It &apos;s so .
The average man , which says that it &apos;s against the abuse of women and girls , and accept privilege that has a position , which is very similar to what I knew as a child , as there were withparing , but yet equals .
Rass discrimination then legally there was 100 years , since 1865 , from Inian of war , over 60 . years old when Lydon Johnson fored laws about the same rights .
But in that moment , there are many white people who didn &apos;t think that race- discrimination &apos;s fine , but they don &apos;t , because I &apos;ve been taking a privileges as a better job , unique approach to work the judge , better schools and everything else , and that &apos;s the same , even today , there &apos;s because the average man who , it &apos;s a fact .
Even a says , &quot; &quot; discrimination against women and girls , &quot; &quot;ment you privileged position .
So what the basic thing we have to do today ?
We usual female in Egypt many don &apos;t say about how are her daughters of reved , and so on .
I won &apos;t do or detail to pay .
But I hope that from this conference comes out that every woman that here is , gets his man that they have their daughters ands to protect against abuseing on campuses , in the military , and so and so on , and the labor markets the future .
I have 12 grandchildren , four children and 10children rightt and often at them and I think ontal situations that they face in America , not just if lived in Egypt or somewhere abroad , in human rights , and I hope that all of you will join me , and will proponents of women and girls across the world , and they protecting human rights .
Thank you very much .
When I here at Oxford studied in &apos; 70s , a future world was without &aposed .
Populaal explosion was stoppviable .
The wholeo explaining faminezz wasn &apos;t .
Epidmy cancer , caused by chemicals in environment , had to with length of our life .
And forests pdal the acid rained .
I told you about from year to year by more than a kilometer or so .
The oil . And we &apos;re spending nuclear winter , with us had to .
None of it , we didn &apos;t . ( Laughter ) And surprisingly , if we look at what is in my life really happened , we &apos;ll find that average income per one average per capita planet is , after outfitted inflation lot of development , has tripled .
D glide life , from my birth increased by 30 percent .
Childhood mortality has come down a factor of about two-thirds .
Production food on a one person has gone up about a third .
And all of this doubled the number of people .
As we do — whether it we for good or bad .
Now how did we do it ?
What &apos;s it , that we are the only species who do the more , the more grows ?
The dot sizes on this diagram , represents the population . &quot; &quot; And his level of GDP per capita .
I think that the answer get , if we realize , as human beings match their brains and allow so combining and forsing ideas , their bringing and crossing .
In other words , we have to realize how ideas are coming .
Imagine , as we from making these objects get to manufacture like this .
Both of them are real objects .
One &apos;s axe of paleoal a 500,000 years , what made Homo erectus .
The second is , of course , the computer mouse .
It &apos;s unusual that both of them have some of the size and shape .
I tried to see which is larger , but that &apos;s nearly impossible .
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both formed for human hand .
They &apos;re technologies . &quot; &quot; After all , it &apos;s a similarity isn &apos;t even so interesting .
The having us that were both built , so that the wasted the human hands .
My interest is difference . Because object on the left you make with tiny change design more than one million years , in die : 1,500,000 — 500,000 years ago .
Homo erectus made the same tool over 300,000 generations .
Of course , there are some change , but tools in that time it transitions slower as the skeleton people .
I don &apos;texisted progress , nor innovation .
It &apos;s an incredible phenomena , but it &apos;s true .
Now , the object in the right is obsolete for five years .
And there &apos;s also another difference , and that &apos;s that the object on the left is made up of one material .
And on the right is made combination of different materials from silicone to the metal , plastics and so forth .
And what &apos;s more to that is combination different ideas , an idea of plastic , laser , the idea of transistors .
Everything that &apos;s in this technology with recombining .
And it &apos;s this combination of , this on afterward technology &apos;s what fascinated . I think that &apos;s the secret to understanding of what &apos;s going on in the world .
Even my body is to accumulating ideas , the idea of leathered cells , brain cells and liver cells .
Everything that &apos;s connected .
As evolution does this accumulation , this abinors ?
We &apos;re using the sexual reproduction .
If appear two different mutations in animals one withoutpo headed species , here tagged green and the red one of them &apos;s got to be a better than the other .
One go extinct , to the other lived .
But if we go about kind of with gender , then can same individual to inherit both mutations of different lines the family .
I headed the individual than allows sos draw from the genetic upgrades around your species .
It &apos;s just limited to their lineage .
And the way they is so effect in the cultural development , what has sex in the biological development ?
I think that the answer is exchange business , us exchange one thing for the other .
It &apos;s a unique human apprta .
There &apos;s no animal don &apos;t .
And there &apos;s learn in labs to the what-to exchange . Of course in animals there &apos;s a mutuality . But exchange one subject for the other would not happen .
&quot; She &apos;d left Adam Smith : &quot; &quot; Nobody has seen this before a dog , who would did fair exchange business bones with others . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The cultures without changing the deal to have you can . &quot;
You can have a no- headed culture .
Chimpanzes , theiller whales and these animals , they have culture .
They s learn traditions that pass on parents to their offspring .
In this case , learn chimpanzees each other &apos;s apart , like they stones .
But the difference here is that these cultures never &apos;s not growing , doesn &apos;t , you don &apos;t grows collecting and never recombining . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s so that we don &apos;t sort of sexual of sex , no exchange of ideas .
So the groups chimpanzees have different cultures .
Now , these are not exchange ideas .
So why , why are so exchange business increase of living ?
The answer allowed in 1817 David Ricardo .
And this is his story in version of the Stone Age , even when he tell him in the connectivity with business between nations .
Adam make for four hours one arrow and in three hours one withkeru .
Oz make for one hour one arrow and in two hours one withkeru .
Oz is from Adam better in producing arrows withkier .
The Adam doesn &apos;t need .
Can you make your own arrows and axe .
Well , not quite , because when understanding invent , if you make the Oz two arrows and Adam two axe and then do business , both of them saved an hour of work .
And the more that will hold onto , the more that &apos;s true . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s the more they do , the better go Adam , production withkier , and Ozov production arrows .
Theing sites of exchange of goods will be so continue to grow up .
And this is one of beauty exchange deal , is actually creating momentum for greater specialization , which then creating momentum for more exchanges and so on .
And I &apos;ve also saved both of Oz for one hour .
This is a prosperity , saving time satisfying needs .
Ask yourself , how much time you had to work , so you do care for one hour of light to read tonight .
If you had to start from scratch , let &apos;s say that you go out to the rural areas .
There &apos;sc . We charge it . You get of it here .
Us you cook it . You your candle and so forth .
How long did I tell you this will it take ? Pretty long .
How long have to today in fact to work in order to earned for an hour of light to read , if you live in the U.K. and the average pay you have ?
The answer is that about a half a seconds .
In 1950 you had to work eight seconds average wages , so you do care so much light .
And that &apos;s seven-and-a-half seconds well-being , who get . So , from 1950 . Because it &apos;s seven-and-a-half seconds , if you can do something different . &quot; &quot; Or you could get another good or a service .
And in 1800 would it took 15 minutes to the average wages for earned for an hour of light .
&quot; In 1800 you would be had to work six hours to earned the candle that would uped an hour .
In other words , an average making the average person you in 1800 couldn &apos;t afford candle .
&quot; Well we &apos;ve pästn picture , and a mouse and let me ask : &quot; &quot; Who , and for whose made them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; lin make someone for themselves . &quot;
It was myself independent .
Today , that &apos;s called poverty .
But object in the right made by other people for me .
How many people ?
&quot; Decades ? &quot; &quot; Hundreds ? &quot; &quot; Thousands of ?
I think it &apos;s to millions .
Because we &apos;ve got to counting the guy that growing coffee that cook for a man that on drill , cut oil , which should make plastics and so on .
They all worked for me , I &apos;ve made to a mouse .
This is how it works society .
This we as a species had achieved .
In ancient ages , when he was person rich , people for him worked literally .
Just so you could be Gods , you had to employ them .
The People &apos;s sling XIV . work a lot of people .
They produced for him the ridiculous the costumes , what &apos;s this one . ( Laughter ) And they were doing to the ridiculous hairstyles .
He was 498 people who preparing for him dinner every day .
But even modern tourist , who walk Versadlean &apos;s psor and looks at images People welcomed XIV . , has a 498 people who they prepare dinner for him .
It &apos;s people in bi hills , cafes , restaurants , and shops around the Paris . They &apos;re all are ready you within hours obs serve a great food , that &apos;s probably more powerful , what the Peoplesd XIV . ever had . &quot;
This is what we &apos;ve made , because we &apos;re working for each other .
We &apos;re able to use specialization and business , to increased each other &apos;s living .
Of course , they &apos;re animals that they work for each other .
The typical example are ants : workers working for queen , and the other way around .
But it &apos;s a big difference that it &apos;s going on only within a particular colonies .
There &apos;s no mutual cooperation among colonies .
And that &apos;s forbe start abu work .
I mean , they specialize given to breed .
That &apos;s in charge of queen .
Our species &apos;s very don &apos;t like .
It &apos;s one thing that we want to conduct all for themselves — reproduction .
( Laughter ) And we don &apos;t even in the U.K. , we reproduction on the queen .
( Applause ) When the this custom originated ?
And how long already exists ? What actually mean ?
I think it &apos;s the oldest version of is about gender aba work .
Now , I don &apos;t have no evidence .
It looks , so that , as the first we started to work man for a woman and a woman for a man .
Today , in every community hunting and gatherings there &apos;s aba work by trying food overall between man hunters and women foragers .
We don &apos;t always it &apos;s so simple . But they &apos;re spread specialized role men and women .
&quot; Beautiful on this system is that it &apos;s benefited for both sides .
This woman knows , in this case tribe Hadza — he wouldn &apos;t roots to them with men swap for meat — knows that if you want to get to the meat , you can dig a few roots to rest and swap them for meat .
And don &apos;t have to help to try to the toys .
And the man again knows that don &apos;t have a bunching , if you want to have roots .
Instead , if you make sure that the words withvi horse &apos;s going to be a great , to share with you in it .
And so both side increase each other living through gender a work .
When it started ? That we don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that &apos;s don &apos;t marksn &apos;t do .
They want to a very large extent cooperate .
So , he was very smart .
Ku the end was their brain in the average bigger than is my or anyone of you in this room .
They were invent . They dead aftere .
They probably have a language , because today , we know that had the same gene called FOXP2 like us . Gne , who discovered here in Oxford .
And it seems that they had language skills .
They were genius people . I don &apos;t want them to .
But we don &apos;t have the evidence for gender a work .
We don &apos;t have the evidence that the women covered harvest .
It seems that women collaborated with men to hunt .
And the other thing , for which there can be no evidence , is business exchange between groups . Because objects that you can find between don &apos;t bra marks remains , made tools , are always of local materials .
For example , Ka show you find theland with the local tools Neanderthal .
I always are made from local corners .
The same valley are human remains from the same period , a 300,000 years . Some are of local corner sheep , but most , many are made from the sort of median , that comes from far away .
And when people started this transmit objects , demonstrates , their group traded .
He &apos;s 10 times as old as agriculture .
People forget this . He regarded as modern invention .
The change retail between groups of people &apos;s hundreds of thousands of years .
And the first evidence that appears in Africa before the 80 — 120,000 years ago , when they &apos;re seeing , is that both sort of median and Ipis goes in Ethiopia for long distances .
And we &apos;ve seen — how you find this team scientists here in Oxford — how they travel from 200 Mediterranean through Algeria inland .
That proves that already people started with exchanged business between groups .
And that &apos;s finally led to specialization .
How do we know that migrating into a long distances means trade , not migration ?
Stop , looking at the modern andborigns , of hunting and gatherings who benefiting stone for axe at a place called Mt . Is , belongs in property tribe Calcutdoon .
They axe exchange in their neighbors behind a day &apos;s the bunches . And so get stone axe in a big parts of Australia .
Puting tools to long distances so it &apos;s the sign of trade , not peak migration .
What happens if people froming exchange business , the ability to exchange and specializing ?
The answer is that , that you can technological development not only slow down , but you can also have to sleeptoy .
An example of Tassing .
When level seas followed and Tassing 10,000 years ago became Islands , where people don &apos;ting with only downgrade development , compared with people on land , but experienced actually regreia .
Inzed skills to make tools of bone , fishing tooling and clothes , because population , roughly 4,000 people , wasn &apos;t a big enough to preserve the specialized skills necessary to sustain technologies that they had .
That &apos;s like all of us sit down to abandoned island .
How many of the things that we have in the pockets , then we would keep able to make a 10,000 years ?
I don &apos;t happen right on Ti Earth , on a similar island with a similar populations .
The reason is that Tis the ground is from South America separates much already know , . And through , is maintained business withsk in those 10,000 years .
Tasans have been isolated .
Let &apos;s go back to this picture and ask for not only that , who and for whose object did , but also , who knew how to make ?
In the case of the stone axe , a man who &apos;ve made , it knew how to do it .
But who knows how to make computer mouse ?
No one . We literally no one .
No one on this planet doesn &apos;t know how to make computer mouse .
And I think it &apos;s serious . &quot;
The principal companies to make computer mice don &apos;t .
He knows just how to knows a company .
One in production lines don &apos;t , because they have no idea how to do oil drilling that got to the oil , from where you make plastic and so on .
We all know only little bits , but nobody know whole .
&quot; Of course , quote from the famous essays Leonardo Rea , an economist , 50 . years , known as &quot; &quot; I , our pencils , &quot; &quot; in which he writes about how pencils and like no one know how we actually make it , because those who put it , don &apos;t benefit graphite . &quot; &quot; And don &apos;t know it &apos;s not benefit wood and things like that . &quot;
As human society we deal with exchange and specialties created the ability to make things , it &apos;s not that we don &apos;t understand .
It &apos;s other , like in the case of language .
In language , they have to pass on more thoughts and ideas , which we &apos;re understanding .
But in technology can make things that transcend our skills .
Capact human mind we &apos;ve been to a remarkable measurements .
By the way , that &apos;s what &apos;s one of the reasons why I &apos;m interested debate about the I.Q. , about whether some groups people have higher IQ than others .
It &apos;s quite trivial .
The company &apos;s what it &apos;s how people are sharing their thoughts and ideas and as working together . It &apos;s , they are her individuals are .
So , we &apos;ve created what we call collective brain .
We &apos;ve only used in networks .
We &apos;re neurons in this brain .
And it &apos;s exchanged ideas , linking and crossing ideas between them , which leads to the development of technologically gradually , bit by bit .
However horrible things would happened .
And in the future , the that we apply ahead , of course , they &apos;rely horrible things .
They war , of economic crisis , natural disaster .
I &apos;m quite sure it &apos;s going to happen in this century &apos;s terrible things .
But I &apos;m sure that , through also the contacts that humans make , and thanks to the options connect and crossing ideas like never before , I &apos;m sure that technology will be to make progresss and with her lifeed level .
Because through the cloud computing , through crowded withuring and through the world from bottom-hore , what we &apos;ve created , we &apos;re not already only elit , but every can have their ideas , connect and crossing them . Pretty certainly so accelerate rate of innovation .
Thank you .
( Applause )
My name is Andst .
So 18 months ago I worked in Google to something else , but under kicking this idea of how to create something about museums and art my boss , which is here , and she &apos;s also me passed .
It took me 18 months .
And let me tell you , this project accompanied amount of a happy interviews and stories with 17-tis very interestings museums of nine-t countries .
So I want to righted at the presentation this program .
The many stories , it &apos;s why we &apos;ve done that .
I think my personal story is very simply explained on the slide , and this is a start .
I grew up in India .
&quot; I got a great education , I can &apos;t complain about it , but I didn &apos;t have access to many museums and an artistic pieces .
So when I began travel and in museums , a lot of I started to learn .
And while I &apos;m working in Google , I &apos;m trying to work on achieves this dream which most by technology .
So , we &apos;ve created team , a big team , and we started work on it .
I &apos;m going to get into the showingt program , and then tell you a couple of examples of the neat things that we get from our begins .
So simply you go on the page GoogleAProject.com.
You look what museums are available .
There are the museum Uffiz , MoMA , Erbbling , Rijks , museum Van Goghha .
So , I went on one of my all-time favorites , Metropolitent museum Arts in New York City .
They &apos;re two ways you get inside , it &apos;s very simple .
Now you and , boom , you &apos;re in a museum .
It doesn &apos;t on it , where there &apos;s currently — the bombs , Mexico , really doesn &apos;t matter .
They &apos;re going inside , talk .
You are somebody who wants to take you in a museum navigated ?
Open plan and one clicks in Get out .
You &apos;re there and you want to go to the endridor .
The continue , for it .
I study this .
( Applause ) Thank you . And I went to the best .
( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m one of my favorites had , from the Kosovo and the Bre-trad of the Metropolitan Museum .
&quot; I see brand &quot; &quot;pus &quot; &quot; . &quot;
If we museum offer image , clicks on it .
This is one of the images .
It &apos;s based on the metadt &apos;s information .
Those of you who &apos;s really interested in art , can click down here — I click here right now .
This is one of the image that we detect something calledgigapixel technology .
So this image for example , accountable about 10 billion pixels .
&quot; A lot of people ask me , &quot; you get 10 billion pixels ? &quot; &quot;
So I &apos;m now to show you what we get with 10 billion pixels .
You can really simply to image .
Here you can see that there &apos;s happening something fun . &quot;
I like this guy , his expressions are amazing .
But you get really into the deep .
So I started move it around and I found something that &apos;s going on here .
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Wait , that &apos;s interesting . &quot; &quot; I continued look , and I noticed that those kids to something banging . &quot;
I &apos;ve done a little survey , I was talking to a few of my contacts of the Metropolitaned museum and I finally figured out that it &apos;s a game called lest game , and is ins hit the kind of cane torong Tuesday .
Obviously it &apos;s very popular .
I don &apos;t know why it &apos;s doing , but something I know about it .
If you want to get even deeper , you can see the marketbs .
And I just told you that could explain from a particular perspective ,ed it , so you can actually see , what do we reach .
Here we were , and this is a painting .
( Applause ) The coolest thing still comes — the second .
Now quickly jump into MoMA , again in New York City .
The next of my favorite , &quot; &quot; Start night . The example that I just showed you , they &apos;s foundeding details .
But what if you want to see the brushsca ?
What if you want to see what Van Gogh actually created this masters pieces ?
Canjoy and really get to deep paintings .
We &apos;re getting to one of my favorite parts of this painting , to small marketlinks .
This is a Starna night , as is probably no one has ever seen .
Let me show you another my favorite virtue .
There &apos;s a lot , but I &apos;m a short time .
This is really amazing part . It &apos;s called Thebirs .
Anyone of you , it &apos;s one , whether you &apos;re rich or poor or you have forpsy house — doesn &apos;t matter .
You can go and create my own museum online , create own collection of all these images .
It &apos;s very simple , get , and it &apos;s . &quot; &quot; I created this collection of called Sed atring — just you can still approaching .
This is In ambassadors , placed in National a gallery .
You can describe stuff , to send friends , to start conversation about what if you feel , if you &apos;re going through these masters friendships pieces .
To conclude , I want to say that for me , it &apos;s probably the most important is that all of these fantastic work doesn &apos;t leave actually from Google .
It didn &apos;t come , I think , even from museums .
I mean , I didn &apos;t have to talk about .
In fact , they come from those artists .
From comes my modest experience .
I want to say that trust live this digitalm medium , whose artistic work fullys and properly have it online .
&quot; The bottomest question that currently I ask is , &quot; &quot; We &apos;d think that &apos;s because to replace the experience walking into the museum ? &quot; &quot; The answer is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
But to her to do it .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
My name is Jane McGonigal . I &apos;m a designer computer games .
In the world of games that really we are reaching more but also .
A World of Warcrafting together they &apos;ve spent 593 million years solution virtual problems countries Andzeroth .
That may not be necessarily something bad .
We emerge out in heart and associate easier &apos;s kind of .
And in the final result you build stronger social relationships .
Each month it be five million people .
That &apos;s the problem , what I &apos;m trying to solve .
It &apos;s artwork , I study , why are great .
Anyway , it &apos;s it &apos;s not the opa situation .
The real world has to more start to play .
I &apos;m also discovered amazing the acted drives , we had the slides .
People have suffered . Fed between each other .
It &apos;s a really exciting time .
Herootos writes that the 18 years and so the king , that I decided to play one last game in cubes .
We &apos;re trying to imagine a perfect triumphs , and then we want to give people the resources to do them .
That &apos;s a game we &apos;ve created in 2007 .
Will you an amazing story and adventure .
We have to play comic book , have a system level in skills than knowledge , bringing knowledge , sustainability , predictness and ingenuity .
&quot; My idea of &quot; &quot; sick &quot; &quot; is a very simple idea that can release billion great ideas , which , in us in a time lum . &quot;
And this simple thing that it can do that , it &apos;s sleep .
— laughter — ( Applause ) — This is a room full of successful women . This is a room
&quot; It &apos;s full of doesn &apos;t women .
I &apos;m in the met a prize sleep .
A two and a half years ago I fainted from the exhaustion and wouldn &apos;t .
And the fall , I head came about table and broke a cheeks towardness , what I &apos;ve had five stitches on the far right eye .
And so I started a journey of discovery importance of sleep .
During this period I &apos;ve studied , interacted with specializations with the doctors and scientists . And now I &apos;m here to tell you explained that the only way to productivem life full ofm satisfaction and inspires leads through enough sleep .
We — ( Applause ) — women , we &apos;re going to play a major role in this revolution . It &apos;s like a benefit of women .
They literally speaking — to get to the top , and it &apos;s literally !
— laughter — ( Applause ) — because unfortunately for men is the deficit sleep something like a symbol of manhood .
Recently I lunched with one guy who turned by last night sleeping only four hours .
&quot; I didn &apos;t taste say — but I told him &apos;s — I wanted to tell him , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
&quot; If you within five hours , this lunch could fall into much more interesting — laughter — &quot; &quot; There &apos;s one kind of lack of sleep always to beed and successful people . &quot;
&quot; Thely here in Washington D.C. , if you want to meet with somebody in the morning and you ask , &quot; &quot; What so around the eighth ? &quot; &quot; , probably you answers : &quot; &quot; the eighth &apos;s too late . But that &apos;s okay . We &apos;ll play tennis , running a few talks and then you encounter about eighth . &quot; &quot; And yet you think they &apos;re an amazinglyload , busy and productive , but the truth is that anything so are not . Because we had about a great leaders — the managers in business , in finance , in politics — who is doing terrible decisions . &quot;
So high I.Q.
doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re good leaders . The bottom line leadership because it &apos;s ability to see the iceberg before it &apos;s going to hit the Titanic .
And to our Titans already , it ran huge amount of glaciers .
I really have the feeling that if society Lehman Brothers ( Lehman brothers ) was Lehman Brothers and Sisters ( Lehman brothers and sisters ) , still would work . (LB as financial institutionsed 15 .09 .2008 )
&quot;- ( Applause ) — &quot; &quot; Whereas allbra &quot; &quot; they were high-load divine every day of the week , maybe you some &quot; &quot; lost time &quot; &quot; not upcoming an iceberg , because the sure woke up after seven-and-a-half-hour or eight-hour of sleep and she &apos;d be able to see things a larger context . &quot;
And so while we face crises all the current world , what &apos;s good for us in personal plane , which we bring more of happiness , gratitude and efficiency into our lives and what &apos;s good for our career , at the same time , it &apos;s best for the whole world .
I &apos;m asking you , asite eyes and discover invest huge ideas that reside in you . Turn off your their engine and discover the power of sleep . &quot;
Thank you .
( Applause ) — —
Well , as Chris highlight I study , the human brain — functions and structure of the human brain .
It &apos;s think for a moment about what it includes .
Here &apos;s this fiddpenin- matter — the three pounds a violinpens that you in the outskirts of the hands , and can degrad contemplate these infiniteity betweenhyden space .
Can you contemplate these life forever , and can degradey thinking about the fact that it &apos;s about sense the infinite .
And this my picturen recuriven the kind of observation that we &apos;re called self-awareness , which I think is Sucwhile Gal of neurod , neuroscience , perhaps , one day we understand .
Okay , so how you study this mysterious organ ?
I mean , you &apos;ve got 100 billion nerve cells , small from places protoplasma , which together interact and from this activity is show entire spectrum of capabilities that we call human nature of and human consciousness .
So how does it do so ?
Well , it &apos;s a lot of ways ofed to functions of the human brain .
One way , that it &apos;s largely use is to study patients with permanent damaged by a small region of their brain , where happened the genetic change in a small regions of the brain .
What &apos;s then to happen , it &apos;s not a wholeed reduce all of your mental capacity , something on the way dumbing your ability to think .
What you &apos;re going , it &apos;s very selecive loss one functions while the other functions remain don &apos;t disrupted , and this gives you some confidence in the argument that this part of the brain is somehow reported in the mediating the functions .
So can interface with structure function and then find out what these circuits they &apos;re doing , to create that particular function .
So this is what trying to do .
Let me show you some of the surpriseives examples .
In fact , in this talk I &apos;ll give you three examples , every after six minutes .
The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome . &quot;
If you look at the first picture , this is temporal lobes , faces , lobesable lobes — lobes that produce brain .
And if you look at the map in internal the surface temporal lobes — there it there &apos;s — it &apos;s a little structure called the fusiform gyrus of .
And that &apos;s called a face area brain because if you damages , you can &apos;t recognize human faces .
I still can people to recognize the voice and say , well okay , that &apos;s Joe , but you can &apos;t look at their face and tell you who it is .
And you don &apos;t recognize ourselves in the mirror .
I mean , you know that it &apos;s you , because if you &apos;re going to str , shrinks to even he and , you know , it &apos;s a mirror , but they actually didn &apos;t recognize it myself as myself .
Okay . This syndrome is well known consequence damageed the fusiform gyrus .
But there &apos;s another rare syndrome , really so rare that heard about him , very few doctors , even between neuroscientists .
&quot; This is called Capgras of , and it &apos;s this about the patient , who &apos;s otherwise completely normal and who suffer the trauma head , takes the coma , otherwise it &apos;s completely okay , looks at her mother and says , &quot; &quot; And this woman , looks exactly like my mother , but it &apos;s frauds — &quot; &quot;
&quot; Is that another woman who pretend that it &apos;s my mother . &quot; &quot; And now , why it &apos;s going on ? &quot;
Why would someone — and this man is completely a number ofed and understanded in all the other directions , but seeing her mother of his act , and on speak him that it &apos;s mother .
Moster interpretation of this that you &apos;d find in all psychiatristtric textbooks is Fre of the widowhood perspective , and that &apos;s that this guy — by the way , the same arguments pay for women , but I &apos;m only going to talk about men —
if you &apos;re still a child , baby , if you feel strong sexual attraction to your mother .
This is the so-called Fressi Oopsian complex .
I &apos;m not saying believe , but it &apos;s a regular Fre of the widowhood view .
And then , like you grow , the brain cortex is ongoing , and suppress these hidden sexual desires in your mother .
Thank God , because otherwise you were all sexually excited at your mother .
And then will be here , to look into your head what damage it cortex , and you &apos;re going to allow this hidden sexual desire on , and on the surface , and simultaneously , unaccountably you find that excites you own mother .
&quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if that &apos;s a my mom , how is it possible that I sexually excited ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s another woman . It &apos;s frauds . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the only explanation , which makes yourm lesioned brain sense . &quot;
It &apos;s never been this argument powers don &apos;t make sense .
It &apos;s very profound , as just all Fre , let &apos;s the arguments- ( Laughter ) — but doesn &apos;t told a big meaning , because I &apos;ve seen the same kind of , patient with the same self-d of his obvi . ( Laughter )
&quot; And say , &quot; &quot; Dr , this isn &apos;t FFi , looks exactly like F-fi , but it &apos;s some other dog . &quot; &quot; Yeah ? &quot;
So , here &apos;s use Fressian explanation .
( Laughter ) You start hidden talk about the best of you inside all the people or something similar , which is of course a completely meaningless . &quot;
So what &apos;s really going on ?
Well to explain this interesting disorder , we look at the structure and functions the normal vision pathways in the brain .
Well , normally visual signals enter inside the our eyes , and travel into the visions brain areas .
In the rear of brain is in fact about 30 areas addressing just vision , and integrating it all , toward news to a little structure called the fusiform gyrus of where we faces .
It &apos;s out there neurons sensitive to faces .
&quot; You can call it a face area brain .
I talked about before .
When it &apos;s this area damaged , you lose the ability to see the faces , right ?
But from this area behave gradually leads into the structure called the amygdala in limic system , the emotionaled core brain , and this structure , called amygdala , emotional measuring the importance of what you &apos;re .
It &apos;s prey ? It &apos;s a predator ? It &apos;s partner ?
Or it &apos;s something completely trivial , like pieces ol , or a little bit of chalk or — I don &apos;t want to show the but — or shoes or something like that , of ? Okay ?
Something that you can completely ignored .
So , if there is amygdala activated and this is important , claning ground for the autonomic nervous system .
Your heart starts beating faster ,
started sweating , to get rid of the heat that you create the muscle &apos;s risk .
And that &apos;s convenient , because to your hand , we can actually put two electrodes and measure change the skinn disgust response to called sweating .
So when we &apos;re looking at something , I can to assess , whether you &apos;re excited by or whether you &apos;re excited to or not , yeah ?
And I &apos;ll get about a moment .
So my idea was that when this guy look at the object — or anything , it goes into the visions areas and — and anyway , it &apos;s processed in the fusiformna fromav , and you &apos; recognize as plays or table , say , or your mother , yeah ?
And then the news gradually that goes into amygdals and then down the autonomic neural system .
Well maybe in this guy , it &apos;s the connection between amyged and the limbic system — emot nuclear accident brain — interrupted .
&quot; So because in the fusiform gyrus is intact , guys can still recognize her mother , and say , &quot; &quot; , looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s because it &apos;s connection to the emotional centers of interrupted , she says , &quot; &quot; How &apos;s possible , if it &apos;s my mother , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t feel any aness ? &quot; &quot; Or horror , which we can also be ? That ? &quot;
&quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s why he says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll explain this unaccountable thenness emotions ? &quot;
This cannot be my mother . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a foreign woman , which gives off for my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test ? &quot;
Well , if we take anyone of you here and stand up in front of a canvas and we measure thingsvanic answer your skin and to project images on a canvas , I know from measure how sweating , when you can see object , like table or an umbrella — of course you don &apos;t hold it .
If you &apos;ll show you a picture of lions or tigers or naked girls , there &apos;s something you start to get sweating , right ?
&quot; And , believe it or not , if you &apos;ll show you a picture of your mother — and I &apos;m talking here about the normal people- you start to sweating .
And you don &apos;t have to be even Jews .
( Laughter ) So what happens , if it &apos;s show this patients ?
You take patients and for him images to a canvas and of focusing his skined thingsvanic response .
Stly and chairs and ols , nothing happened , as the normal people , when you picture you show him his mother , things likevanic leathered the answer is flat .
What is missing is emotional response to his mother &apos;s the connection because that &apos;s field of vision into emoal centers is interrupted .
So his vision is normal , because the visual areas are normal , his emotions are normal — will laughing , will be cry , and so forth — but from connection to emotions is interrupted and suffer from because of that his mother &apos;s frauds .
It &apos;s lovely example kind of things that we do , take bizzarded , seemingly incomprehensible , neuro-psyric syndrome and for your hands that the classic Fre of the widowhood is wrong that , in fact , it know precisely be explained in terms of known neuroanatoms of the brain .
&quot;ms go , if this patient , his mother from neighboring room calls — phone — and he raises the head and says , &quot; &quot; Wow , mom , as you &apos;ve got ? &quot; &quot; Where are you ? &quot; &quot; The phone no kind of doesn &apos;t exist . &quot;
&quot; And then the village to him it comes up to me , and he says , &quot; &quot; Who are you ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; looks exactly like my mother . &quot; &quot; Yeah ? &quot;
The reason for that is that there &apos;s a head of a department of hearings centers in the brain in the centers the emotionalal , and that accident was not interrupted .
So this explains why her mother phones without problems recognize .
When it &apos;s personally , says that it &apos;s frauds .
I mean , like this complex system circuits in the brain constructed ?
It &apos;s nature , genes or it &apos;s the parenting ?
And this problem we go so that we appreciate another interesting syndrome called phantom limbs .
And you all know what it &apos;s phantom limbs .
When amputing your hand or your foot , because of gangrene or lose them in war , for example , in the Iraq War- now it &apos;s a real serious issue — to continue to a very , very vividly after the feel the present lacking hands and we call this phantoms arm or leg .
In fact , can you of this phantom , almost at every single part of the body .
Believe it or not , even at an internal bones .
I was patient with eliminated meteric — after a hysterectomy — that had phantom myteric , including phantom emissions office change systems of pain in the right age moon .
He was me one student asked if they get a phantom of a changeturation syndrome ?
( Laughter ) The subject worthy scientific explorations , and we &apos;re after that don &apos;t go there .
So the next question is , what &apos;s about phantom limbs can find out of trials .
One of the things that we &apos;ve discovered , was that about half patients with your phantom limbs say that can with his phantome to move .
The taps brother on the shoulder , raises phones when theing , the parting a frog .
They &apos;re very impressive , living feelings .
Patient don &apos;t suffers of .
Does that hand there but even though it &apos;s for a compelling a sensual experience .
However , in about half the patients to do not .
&quot; Theantom limbs — they say , &quot; &quot; But Mr. doctor , the phantom limbs is no . &quot;
It &apos;s like the animal , , fromsred in a flock and unbearably hurts .
If I with her only toh , maybe I relieved from pain . Why would be phantom limbs in ?
Sounds like againstreate .
But when we &apos;re looking at to affectiss , we found that in these people with a quadriplegics phantom limbs , your hand was original paralyzed by because of bareland peripheral ne initial ,
don &apos;t real stocking hand , was interrupted , was disconnected , say , the motorcyclelo accident .
So for patient had a real hand , which wasla , for a couple of months &apos; or six year ofhyms in a popru and then we experimented to this pain in your hand to get him surgeon arm amputs and has a phantom hand with the same-s pains .
And this is serious clinical problem .
The patients can be governed by the depression .
Some of them it into the outbreak suicide .
So how to treat this syndrome ?
Why rises in phantom limbs ?
When I looked into the affectists , I &apos;ve found that patients should real hand and nerves that it supplied , were reved and real hand abouting all and laying of suspended to struhu several months before the amputation and this pain has went even into the phantom .
Why that happens ?
&quot; When was hand &apos;s pristine , but in frontal brain into hands send commands , saying &quot; &quot; ck &quot; &quot; buted putting a visual feedback &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Pohani . No . Pohani . No . Pohani . &quot; &quot; No . &quot;
And this is inpe beginning in the circuits in the brain , and we &apos;ve called &apos;s trained in meeting , okay ?
The brain learn , as a result of this Hebs andssociative connection that simple movement command in the hand is creating feeling overwhelmed hands
and then when arm amput , this trained in movement bring into your notion of body and in your phantom .
But how do these patients help ?
How do you get fromn to sharpened in of it to make iting from a ni column , animaling stands out the phantom &apos;s hands ?
Well , let &apos;s what if you sent phantom commands , but they gave him a series visual feedback that my command the head ?
Perhaps you &apos;ve done away from the phantom &apos;s pain phantom &apos;s a cramps .
How do you do it ? &quot; &quot; Well , virtual reality .
But it cost millions of dollars .
So I found a way to do in three dollars , but he doesn &apos;sravise &apos;s my sponsor .
( Laughter ) Okay ? What you do is that you create &apos;s what I call the mirror a box .
You have a cardboard box with mirror in the middle , and then you put phantom — so , my first patient , Derek , came .
Ru of him amputed 10 years ago .
He was taken from shoulders , so nerves were taken and hand quadriplegic , laid year of suspended to stru and then was and amputated .
He had a phantom hand , unbearably a painful with it and couldn &apos;t move .
It &apos;s no phantoms hand .
So they came up and I gave him this mirror , in a box which I call the mirror a box .
Patient puts his left side phantom hand that &apos;s a series ofsre in a flocks on the left side of the mirror , healthy hand on the right side of mirror and give it into the same semi-hy , ofscret , looks in the mirror and what get ?
And looking at that , as is his phantom revived because looks at his hand healthy reflection in the mirror , and it looks like , how would was this phantom refreshed .
&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; do look , cring his phantomes true — your fingers or move real fingers , until you will you look in the mirror . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s going to have a visual impression , phantom moves . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s obvious , but surprising thing is that patient at that says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom again moving and pain , animaling the allowed . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patient who he walked — ( Applause ) — thank you . ( Applause ) My first patient he walked in , look in the mirror , and I said to him , &quot; &quot; Look at suddenly your phantom . &quot; &quot; And he started gigting and says , &quot; &quot; I see your phantom . &quot; &quot; But isn &apos;t stupid . Does that it &apos;s not real . &quot;
It knows that it &apos;s the mirror suddenly , but it &apos;s living a sensual experience .
&quot; And now , I said , &quot; &quot; move my hand healthy and phantome . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my phantma . &quot; &quot; You know it yet . It &apos;s painful . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; move my hand healthy . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom again , moving , I can &apos;t believe it ! &quot;
&quot; And my pain is gone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; And then I said , &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; Intri eyes closed your eyes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; move your hand of healthy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s , again , is in-s views . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; Okay , open your eyes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; Oh my God , oh my God , again moves ! &quot;
Well , and he looked like a child , in the sugar .
So I thought , okay , well this demonstrates my theory of tiled in and crucial role of the visual input , but I won &apos;t Nobel Prize for that someone help move his phantomal limb .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) when you think about it , it &apos;s completely useless ability . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
But then I started to realize that maybe to other species in the which you can in neurology to meet , like stroke , the causes dysstonia — can be a certain trained ingredient that you can overcome simple inventions for a mirror .
&quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Look , &quot; &quot; Derek- well , in particular , the guy with you can &apos;t all wear mirror to alleviate their pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Look Derek , take it home and traininguj with him week or two . &quot;
&quot; Maybe after a while exercise of &quot; &quot; goes without a mirror , fromnas the meetings , start move his in- hand , and then she &apos;s , &quot; &quot; pain . &quot; &quot; So he said fine and take it home . &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Look , finally , it &apos;s two dollars . Take it home . &quot; &quot; So I took it home and after two weeks , called me and said , &quot; &quot; Dr , this won &apos;t to believe . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What for ? &quot; &quot; And , &quot; &quot; he &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; So I ask , &quot; &quot; What is gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought that maybe disappeared mirrors box . &quot;
&quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know the phantom , I had the last 10 years ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; disappear . &quot; &quot; And I said — I started concerned , say , thought , my God , I mean , I turn his picture of a body where remained human page , aka , and all this ? &quot;
&quot; And I said , &quot; &quot;erc , disturbing ? &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s you , &quot; &quot; No , I didn &apos;t have other three days phantom hand- and so no phantomous pain elbow , no animaling , no phantom-flak in front of pain , all the pain are gone . &quot;
&quot; But the problem is that I &apos;m still phantomous fingerss from my shoulder and your box there we will never . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , could you change the design and give me it on the forehead , so I , you know , to reached and could take out your phantomous fingers ? &quot; &quot; He thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a magician . &quot;
So , what &apos;s happening ?
It &apos;s the case , because the brain is faced with a huge sense contradictions .
From vision gets news , phantom &apos;s back .
On the other hand , there &apos;s no competent perception , muscles signals tells you that hand &apos;s not there , OK ?
And your movement commands say that hand here &apos;s and for this conflict you brains say , the hell with , there &apos;s not any phantom , there is no hand .
It gets to some forms of rejecting — we &apos;re in denial signals .
And when it &apos;s gone hand , bonus is that it &apos;s gone also pain , because you can &apos;t have from physical a floating paining in space .
So that &apos;s a bonus .
But , and this technique was from trying on dozens patients in other groups in Helsins so you can show how valuable the treatment phantom &apos;s pain and really , people it tried to rehabilitation of stroke are being .
The deads normally you &apos;re thinking as a lesions in the strands , nothing what could do something .
Well it turns out that a certain ingredientsing of stroke are being is also trained in meeting , and maybe this ingredient gave to overcome using mirrors .
This also were clinical exams , and actually helped a lot of and many patients .
Okay , let me now go on the third part of my talk , which is about next interesting phenomenon callednesthesia .
It was discovered the Francis Galton &apos;s in the 19th century .
It &apos;s cousin of Charles Darwin .
I showed that some people in population , who are other ways , completely normal , had to follow fromspeciallyness — whenever they saw number , was colorful .
Five is blue , with a seven yellow , green a wasps &apos; , the ninth , &quot; &quot; Yellow &quot; &quot; indgo .
Remember that these people are in all other ways normal .
Or high C . Sometimes note to call the sense colors .
high C is blue , high F green , another note can be yellow , yeah ?
Why is happening ?
This is called a synesia — Galton &apos;s called sonsthes , foring a senses .
For us are all of the senses to discriminated .
These people up their senses .
And why this is happening ?
One of two different aspects of this problem &apos;s very bizarre .
Synesthesia it occurs in people &apos;s families , so Galton to concluded that has dediation base , genetic basis .
And second , synesia is about — and here that brings me to my point about the main the theme of this session , which is creativity — synesia is eight times more between artists , poets , authors and other creatives people than it is in the normal population .
Why is that ?
The water tell this question .
No one &apos;s it &apos;s not .
Okay , what &apos;s son growing ? What caused it ?
Well , it &apos;s a lot of theories .
&quot; One says that are just crazy .
Well , it &apos;s not very scientific theory , so at her we can forget .
Then it &apos;s report that they are lyings and persevered .
Well , it can be partly true , because it &apos;s more erred here , in Bay Andre than in San Diego .
( Laughter ) Okay . So , a third theory — well , let &apos;s say , about what really tonesia idea ? Okay ?
So we found that area color and area numbers are in the brain , in the fusiformna fromav , right next to myself .
So we said , there &apos;s in the brain that random evening between color and numbers .
And so whenever you see number , you see answer a color and so you suffer sonsthesy .
Remember — you know , why it &apos;s going on ?
Why wouldn &apos;t in some of these people should be circuits crossed ?
Do you remember , as I say , it &apos;s occurs in people &apos;s families ?
This brings you to track .
And that &apos;s that there is areal gene , himation in gene , which causes this crossing circuits .
As it turns out , each one of us , it has at birth connected everything with everybody .
So each part of the brain is involved with every other realm , and these connections are cleaned , to create characteristic moduleryn architecture adult brain .
So , if there is a gene causesing this for abandoning , and if you &apos;re going to hised him you &apos;re going to bother inadequate department neighboring brain areas
and if it &apos;s case numbers and color , you get numbersh- color-nesthesia .
If it &apos;s synes and colors , you get a sound-ne color-sy .
So far it &apos;s understandable .
And now , what if it &apos;s this gene ex depressed everywhere in the brain , so that everything is connected ?
&quot; Well , think what have artists , writers and poets in common , it &apos;s ability to engage metaphorical thinking connecting the seemingly unsy ideas , like , &quot; &quot; the East is and Juliet is the sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t normally Juliet is the sun- means that it &apos;s thatras round of fire ? &quot;
I want to say , with schizophrenireard &apos;s doing it , but it &apos;s another story .
Well , normally people say is ana than the sun , like sun , makes life as the sun .
And they immediately did you find these connection .
If you &apos;ll assume that this vaster connection and terms there are other parts of the brain , then it leads to more tend to metaphoricalm thinking and creativity in people with sonsthesy .
And for this reason is eight times higher synesthesia between poets , artists and writers .
Okay , it &apos;s very h logical view ofnesthesia .
The last demonstration of — even minute ...
( Applause ) All right . Let me show you that you all are synesth , but you &apos;re in denial .
Here I have what I calls that Martian alphabet , like your and  , &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s A , B is B , C is C ,
different shapes for different phonemes , yeah ?
Here you have that Martianex alphabet .
One of them is Kki , the other one is Buba .
Which is Kki and which Burba ?
How many of you think that &apos;s Kiki and that &apos;s Burba ? &quot; &quot; Raise your hands .
Well , that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got one or two mutants .
( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s Buba , that &apos;s Kiki ? &quot; &quot; Raise your hands ,
99 percent of you .
And now , no one of you is not that Martian , how did you do that ?
It &apos;s because they all make crossed model — sonstic and abstract to learn — which means that says , that &apos;s sharp curves , Kiki , in your auditory cortex , irritating in badk cells , Kiki , mimics the visual curves — the block the-ness of abated shape .
This is very important , because it tells you that your brain does something that looks like a stupid ly , but photons in your eye creating this shape and inaffeed the cells in your ear to inspire sound pattern , the brain is able to choose their common denominator .
It &apos;s a primitive form and abstractions , and now we know that that happens in the fusiformna fromaving brain , because when it &apos;s damaged , these people lose the ability to create Buba Kiki , but also lose the ability to think in metaphors .
&quot; If you this guy ask : &quot; &quot; No , that &apos;s all gold , what &apos;s dots &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s that it &apos;s metal and glossy doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s gold . &quot;
You &apos;ve got to measure the- density , not ? So them completely escape metaphoric importance .
So this area is about eightx bigger in higher primates , particularly in people , as the lower primates .
In this jana fromavings of something really interesting , because it &apos;s the crossroad between hearing , vision and the  and in people &apos;s a huge — and there &apos;s something very interesting .
And I think that &apos;s the basis for a lot of entirely human ability as and abstractuction , metaphors and creativity .
All these questions that philosophers studied after millennia we can we scientists start to explore imaging brain , exploring patients and asking the right questions .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Sorry .

This story is about imagination as taking seriously .
So 14 years ago , I first came across this ordinary material , fishingland network that you use the same way for several century .
Today , we &apos;ve used it to create stoods , meaninged forming , about the size of a normal buildings in cities around the world .
It certainly wasn &apos;t person that would something done .
I &apos;ve never studied withsculture , engineering , or architecture .
In fact , after high school belonged to seven schools and artist refused me on each of them .
I decided that I would artist on a for 10 years , and I drew , and I got a Fulbright scholarships to India .
It &apos;s a promise exhibitions my had , I sent a their painting and came into Mahaboipur .
It says term show came — but my paintings don &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This fishing village was known sculptureculture .
So I tried from pouring bronze .
But big different fromats were too difficult and expensive .
I went I went for a walk on the beach , I watched fishermen networking in a networks of on the sand .
We just observed them every day , but this time I saw differently — new approach to sarosity , way to make volume formed without difficult and durable materials .
My first satisfying withcueptunru I created with these fishermen .
&quot; It &apos;s self-portraits called &quot; &quot; largeed sides . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They even have trained them into pillar to get to photograph . &quot;
I learned that it &apos;s a surface reveal everyone ines wind in constantly shifting patterns .
And I wasnottised .
She &apos;d on artisanaled the tradition and collaborated artists , and then in Lit manufacturers a chips .
And I loved me the subtle detail that &apos;s it into my work , but it &apos;s mostly I wanted to — push them from object that you &apos;re looking at something that you could lose it .
So I came back to India that I can work together with these fishings , we developed a network of a million and a half by hand of bounds nodes — recently , install decentralized in the Madrid , .
Thousands of people saw it , one of them was urbanist Manal Sola-Morles that sets for a designed the riverbanks in Por , in Portugal .
He asked me if I could this build as consistent pieces for the city .
I didn &apos;t , if I managed to , I saved your art .
Ited , constructed , costs — these are opposs more pre-name , destly and the fleeting .
It took me two years than I found a thread that would survived ultraviolet beams , withed air , pollution , and at the same time , acted up your faceness , to freeing in the wind .
We needed something that would maintained network up there , in the middle of the traffic warden node .
So we &apos;re off this 45,000 pounds (20 412 pounds ) hard ring , a steel ring .
We had to build , so that they la bottom moving in common in banks and survived Hurricanes .
We didn &apos;t be nouction software tomodeled something porn and moving .
I discovered an amazing flying icon of Gar engine machine , which designs for flow ship ma ship of American jar , called Peter Hep suffering .
He help me to deal with this double challenge — precisey shape , and it &apos;s a movement .
I couldn &apos;t build it in a way that I knew , because by hand ined the nodes would keep don &apos;t a hurricane .
So I got together with industrial plant of mine to make fishing nets as they &apos;ve learned , as machines work , and found a way to create landscape with them .
We didn &apos;t no language , which we have translated this old , don &apos;t understandable arts in something that can make me .
So we &apos;ve created .
Three years later , we &apos;re two kids and they learn this 50,000 square feet (4645 feet square ) chipsed network .
It was incredible — what I be now cost , permanent and at the same time , nothing forsune &apos;s .
( Applause ) This intersection of was about nothing and anonymous .
Now has his breath .
I walked under that for the first time .
We just observed how wind the type of choreography gradually open , protected I felt , and it &apos;s also attached to infinite heaven .
My life will never be the same .
I want to make with these mas oass in the halls of the cities all around the world .
And I &apos;m going to share two directions that are in my work new .
Thestoric city office Philadelphia : I really felt that his square needs material for withcuept , which would be lighter than a network .
So we &apos;re experimenting with tiny sprayed pieces water , to create a dry mlus that would be shaped by the wind . Testing we discovered that it could be shaped by people , can each appeal , move through it without &apos;s .
They &apos;s this with a material as the showing the rail trains feet on the surface in real time — as an X-ray decomposeing of the urban circulearing system .
The next challenge , Biennial America in Denver he asked me if I could displays 35 national Western hesph and their interconnectedness apted .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t I , where I &apos;m start , but I said yes .
I read about recently earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that just swed around the Pacific Oceans .
We &apos;ve drifted the grounds these tectonic the board ,ed the ground try rotation and literally with reduced the length of the day .
Thecontacted NOAA &apos;s (N seeded Ocean and And &apos;feric It ) , and asked them if would provide me data about tsunami , and it into something that looks like that .
&quot; The name of : &quot; &quot;261 . &quot; &quot; means the number of microseconds , about how much was the Earth &apos;s day a shorter . &quot;
This didn &apos;t create the way that I knew — steel &apos;s circle .
This shape was now too complex .
So I &apos;ve changed the gears for fine , smooth skin fiber , which was 15 times stronger than steel .
Thecueptunra now could be completely , because it was so light , could harness the existing buildings — literally to become part of the structure of the city .
We didn &apos;t no software that would pushed for these complex networks forms and modeled them with gravity .
So we had to create .
Then I called about somebody from New York City and ask if I could adapt these concepts on the Times Square or the Highline (par in New-Y City ) .
This new structured method allows me to model and build these withcueptunry in the range of skyscrapers .
We &apos;re not being touched , but now dreaming about their went in cities around the world , where there &apos;s their most to . &quot;
So 14 years ago , I &apos;m searching through beauty in the traditional things , in artisanaled forms .
Today , their combineing with a-tech materials and machineculture I &apos;m going to created sensed , molding , the size of buildings .
My art the horizons are constantly pushing .
Today , walk with this story .
I called my friend from Ping .
It represents in offices that never cared art , never onceed local art museum , of everybody who survives could , tried to get from building out and make them light to be withcueptunru .
They were in suits , lying on the grass , and take a look at what were the shifting rendering wind , next to people that we don &apos;t know , and shared reinventing the world of wonder .
Thank you . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you , thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
This graph we read so that we look at my age indosal axis .
The adolescence you maybe we outside of a map .
She &apos;s six months .
( Applause )
I became basically baby in the body women .
If you &apos;ve ever seen human brain , you know , it &apos;s two sph from ourselves are quite separated .
With permission . Thank you . It &apos;s very happy . ( Ast : That was . )
Information in the form of energy flows at once the entire our sensoric system and then it explodes into an immense , the round of how this moment now looks like , like this moment now ining and tastes how you feel , and as sounds like .
I &apos;m energy being associated with energy around me consciousness my right sphere .
At this moment , we perfect , around and wonderful .
My left-hand hemispher — our left-hand hemispher — is completely other place .
Our left-hand hemispher think linear and policydically .
Our left-hand hemispher think &apos;s language .
The only thing I knew , was distinguish energy — energy .
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s happened to me ? &quot; &quot;
And in his body it felt the easy . Imagine : &quot; &quot;
